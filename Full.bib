abstract = {Young brown dwarfs share many properties with directly imaged giant extrasolar planets. They therefore provide unique laboratories for investigating the full range of temperature and mass encompasses by the growing collection of planets discovered outside our Solar System. Furthermore, if they can be tied to a particular group of coeval stars, they also provide vital anchor points for low-mass empirical isochrones. We have developed a novel procedure for identifying such objects based on their unique 2MASS and AllWISE colors. Using our search criteria, we have identified 50 new, late-type L dwarf candidates, 47 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as L dwarfs with follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy. We evaluate the potential membership of these objects in nearby, young moving groups using their proper motions, photometric distance estimates, and spectroscopic indicators of youth, and find seven likely L-type members belonging to the {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pictoris moving group, the AB Doradus moving group, the Tucana-Horologium association, or the Argus association, in addition to several lower probability members.

abstract = {We have discovered that the extremely red, low-gravity L7 dwarf 2MASS J11193254-1137466 is a 0.14" (3.6 AU) binary using Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging. 2MASS J11193254-1137466 has previously been identified as a likely member of the TW Hydrae Association (TWA). Using our updated photometric distance and proper motion, a kinematic analysis based on the BANYAN II model gives an 82{\%} probability of TWA membership. At TWA's 10{\$}\backslashpm{\$}3 Myr age and using hot-start evolutionary models, 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB is a pair of {\$}3.7{\^{}}{\{}+1.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.9{\}}{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} brown dwarfs, making it the lowest-mass binary discovered to date. We estimate an orbital period of {\$}90{\^{}}{\{}+80{\}}{\_}{\{}-50{\}}{\$} years. One component is marginally brighter in {\$}K{\$} band but fainter in {\$}J{\$} band, making this a probable flux-reversal binary, the first discovered with such a young age. We also imaged the spectrally similar TWA L7 dwarf WISEA J114724.10-204021.3 with Keck and found no sign of binarity. Our evolutionary model-derived {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} estimate for WISEA J114724.10-204021.3 is {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}230 K higher than for 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB, at odds with their spectral similarity. This discrepancy suggests that WISEA J114724.10-204021.3 may actually be a tight binary with masses and temperatures very similar to 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB, or further supporting the idea that near-infrared spectra of young ultracool dwarfs are shaped by factors other than temperature and gravity. 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB will be an essential benchmark for testing evolutionary and atmospheric models in the young planetary-mass regime.},

We present a suite of spectroscopic, imaging, and time-series observations to characterize the physical and environmental properties of this system. Moderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of ROXs 12 B from Gemini-North/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS reveals signatures of low surface gravity including weak alkali absorption lines and a triangular {\$}H{\$}-band pseudo-continuum shape.

abstract = {Brown dwarfs form like stars but, with masses below 0.075 solar masses, or 1.5 {\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} 1029 kg, they fail to ignite core hydrogen fusion. Lacking a central energy source, they cool and fade on timescales that are rapid by astronomical standards. Consequently, the observed characteristics of old, cold brown dwarfs provide insight into the expected properties of gas-giant exoplanets. This review focuses on brown dwarfs as companions to main-sequence and evolved stars. Following a brief historical introduction, we consider the different techniques used to identify very low mass companions of stars and discuss the advantages and challenges associated with each method. We summarise results from observational programs, particularly those regarding companion frequency as a function of mass and separation, including discussion of the so-called `brown dwarf desert'. We consider the implications of those results for brown dwarf and planetary formation mechanisms. Finally, we outline future surveys for low mass companions, particularly direct imaging programs that will have sufficient sensitivity to detect objects of planetary mass.},

abstract = {Abstract It is found that in a rotating stratified fluid bounded by a single rigid wall, edge waves may occur at all frequencies less than or equal to N sin a (a is the angle of the wall from the horizontal and N the Brunt‐Vaisala frequency). These decay exponentially away from the boundary, in a distance of O(S) wavelengths, for $\alpha$ = O(1), or O(S ‐1) wavelengths, for $\alpha$S ≤ O(1), where S is the ratio of N to the Coriolis parameter f, taken for illustration to be large. The phase and energy both move with a component to the left, facing shallow water. The waves could, for example, appear as an internal tide at the continental rise or as baroclinic meandering of currents over a slope. The low‐frequency limit, $\alpha$S ≪ 1, is studied in detail. To allow for large scales of motion other rigid boundaries and variations in f are included. The edge (actually “bottom") waves then merge with topographic‐planetary waves as the wavelengths increase; the familiar depth‐independent mode is found to be possible in the sea for wavelengths exceeding about 450 km. The {\ss}‐effect introduces modes complementary to that trapped at the bottom, which instead are isolated from it.},

abstract = {We have obtained projected rotation velocities (vsini) of a sample of 19 ultracool dwarfs with spectral types in the interval M6.5-T8 using high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with NIRSPEC and the Keck II telescope. Among our targets there are two young brown dwarfs, two likely field stars, and fifteen likely brown dwarfs (30-72 Mjup) of the solar neighborhood. Our results indicate that the T-type dwarfs are fast rotators in marked contrast to M-type stars. We have derived vsini velocities between {\textless}15 and 40 km/s for them, and have found no clear evidence for T dwarfs rotating strongly faster than L dwarfs. However, there is a hint for an increasing lower envelope on moving from mid-M to the L spectral types in the vsini-spectral type diagram that was previously reported in the literature; our vsini results extend it to even cooler types. Assuming that field brown dwarfs have a size of 0.08-0.1 Rsol, we can place an upper limit of 12.5 h on the equatorial rotation period of T-type brown dwarfs. In addition, we have compared our vsini measurements to spectroscopic rotational velocities of very young brown dwarfs of similar mass available in the literature. The comparison, although model-dependent, suggests that brown dwarfs lose some angular momentum during their contraction; however, their spin down time seems to be significantly longer than that of solar-type to early-M stars.},

abstract = {In this paper, we quantify and discuss the physical and surface chemical processes leading to the formation, temporal evolution and sedimentation of dust grains in brown dwarf and giant gas planet atmospheres: nucleation, growth, evaporation and gravitational settling. Considering dust particles of arbitrary sizes in the different hydrodynamical regimes (free molecular flow, laminar flow, turbulent flow), we evaluate the equilibrium drift velocities (final fall speeds) and the growth rates of the particles due to accretion of molecules. We show that a depth-dependent maximum size of the order of a{\_}max {\~{}} 1 mum (upper regions) ... 100 mum (lower regions) exists, which depends on the condensate and the stellar parameters, beyond which gravitational settling is faster than growth. Larger particles can probably not be formed and sustained in brown dwarf atmospheres. We furthermore argue that the acceleration towards equilibrium drift is always very fast and that the temperature increase of the grains due to the release of latent heat during the growth process is negligible. Based on these findings, we formulate the problem of dust formation coupled to the local element depletion/enrichment of the gas in brown dwarf atmospheres by means of a system of partial differential equations. These equations state an extension of the moment method developed by Gail Sedlmayr (1988) with an additional advective term to account for the effect of size-dependent drift velocities of the grains. A dimensionless analysis of the new equations reveals a hierarchy of nucleation -{\textgreater} growth -{\textgreater} drift -{\textgreater} evaporation, which characterises the life cycle of dust grains in brown dwarf atmospheres. The developed moment equations can be included into hydrodynamics or classical stellar atmosphere models. Applications of this description will be presented in a forthcoming paper of this series.},

abstract = {We present ground-based spectroscopic verification of six Y dwarfs (see Cushing et al), eighty-nine T dwarfs, eight L dwarfs, and one M dwarf identified by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Eighty of these are cold brown dwarfs with spectral types greater than or equal to T6, six of which have been announced earlier in Mainzer et al and Burgasser et al. We present color-color and color-type diagrams showing the locus of M, L, T, and Y dwarfs in WISE color space. Near-infrared classifications as late as early Y are presented and objects with peculiar spectra are discussed. After deriving an absolute WISE 4.6 um (W2) magnitude vs. spectral type relation, we estimate spectrophotometric distances to our discoveries. We also use available astrometric measurements to provide preliminary trigonometric parallaxes to four our discoveries, which have types of L9 pec (red), T8, T9, and Y0; all of these lie within 10 pc of the Sun. The Y0 dwarf, WISE 1541-2250, is the closest at 2.8 (+1.3,-0.6) pc; if this 2.8 pc value persists after continued monitoring, WISE 1541-2250 will become the seventh closest stellar system to the Sun. Another ten objects, with types between T6 and {\textgreater}Y0, have spectrophotometric distance estimates also placing them within 10 pc. The closest of these, the T6 dwarf WISE 1506+7027, is believed to fall at a distance of roughly 4.9 pc. WISE multi-epoch positions supplemented with positional info primarily from Spitzer/IRAC allow us to calculate proper motions and tangential velocities for roughly one half of the new discoveries. This work represents the first step by WISE to complete a full-sky, volume-limited census of late-T and Y dwarfs. Using early results from this census, we present preliminary, lower limits to the space density of these objects and discuss constraints on both the functional form of the mass function and the low-mass limit of star formation.},

abstract = {We present results from a high-resolution spectroscopic survey of 45 L dwarfs, which includes both very low mass stars and brown dwarfs. Our spectra allow us to derive a significant number of new rotational velocities, and discover a slowly rotating (in projected velocity) L dwarf that allows more accurate measurement of spectroscopic rotations for these objects. We measure chromospheric activity (and often its variability) through the H$\alpha$ emission line. Our primary new result is good evidence that magnetic braking dominates the angular momentum evolution of even brown dwarfs, although spindown times appear to increase as mass decreases. We confirm that activity decreases as effective temperature decreases, although a larger fraction of L dwarfs are active than has previously been reported. Essentially all active objects are also variable. We confirm the lack of a rotation-activity connection for L dwarfs. We find a minimum limit for rotational velocities that increases with later spectral types, rising from near zero in older mid-M stars to more than 20 km s-1 for mid-L objects. There is strong evidence that all L dwarfs are rapid rotators. We derive a braking law that can depend on either temperature or mass which can explain all the rotational results and provides an age dependence for the angular momentum evolution. It is clear that angular momentum loss mechanisms in smaller and cooler objects become more inefficient, starting at the fully convective boundary.},

They are grouped in loose young associations, sharing similar kinematical and physical properties, but, due to their vicinity to the Sun, they are dispersed in the sky, and hard to identify. Their strong stellar coronal activity, causing enhanced X-ray emission, allows them to be identified as counterparts of X-ray sources. The analysis presented here is based mainly on the SACY project, aimed to survey in a systematic way counterparts of ROSAT all-sky X-ray sources in the Southern Hemisphere for which proper motions are known. We give the definition, main properties, and lists of high-probability members of nine confirmed loose young associations that do not belong directly to the well-known Oph-Sco-Cen complex. The youth and vicinity of many members of these new associations make them ideal targets for follow-up studies, specifically geared towards the understanding of planetary system formation. Searches for very low-mass and brown dwarf companions are ongoing, and it will be promising to search for planetary companions with next generation instruments.},

We identify PSO J060.3200+25.9644 (near-infrared spectral type L1) and PSO J077.1033+24.3809 (L2) as new members of Taurus based on their VL-G gravity classifications, the consistency of their photometry and proper motions with previously known Taurus objects, and the low probability of contamination by field objects.

Both Taurus objects are among the lowest mass free-floating objects ever discovered, with estimated masses {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}6 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}, and provide further evidence that isolated planetary-mass objects can form as part of normal star-formation processes.

A Palomar/TripleSpec near-infrared spectrum of W1925 confirms a previously estimated photometric L7 spectral type by Scholz et al. 2018, and its infrared colors and absolute magnitudes are consistent with a single object of this type. We constructed a spectral energy distribution using the Gaia parallax, literature photometry and near infrared spectrum and find a luminosity log(Lbol/LSun) = -4.443+/-0.008. Applying evolutionary models, we infer that W1925 is likely a 53+/-18 MJup brown dwarf with Teff=1404+/-71 K and log g =5.1+/-0.4 dex (cgs). While W1925 was detected in both the 2MASS and WISE infrared sky surveys, it was not detected in photographic plate sky surveys. Its combination of extreme optical-infrared colors, high proper motion, and location near the crowded Galactic plane (b = -4.2 deg) likely contributed to it having evaded detection in pre-Gaia surveys.},

All rights reserved..We present the results of a precise near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity (RV) survey of 32 low-mass stars with spectral types K2-M4 using CSHELL at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility in the K band with an isotopologue methane gas cell to achieve wavelength calibration and a novel, iterative RV extraction method. We surveyed 14 members of young (≈25-150 Myr) moving groups, the young field star ϵ Eridani, and 18 nearby ({\textless}25 pc) low-mass stars and achieved typical single-measurement precisions of 8-15 m s-1with a long-term stability of 15-50 m s-1 over longer baselines. We obtain the best NIR RV constraints to date on 27 targets in our sample, 19 of which were never followed by high-precision RV surveys. Our results indicate that very active stars can display long-term RV variations as low as ∼25-50 m s-1 at ≈2.3125 $\mu$m, thus constraining the effect of jitter at these wavelengths. We provide the first multiwavelength confirmation of GJ 876 bc and independently retrieve orbital parameters consistent with previous studies. We recovered RV variabilities for HD 160934 AB and GJ 725 AB that are consistent with their known binary orbits, and nine other targets are candidate RV variables with a statistical significance of 3$\sigma$-5$\sigma$. Our method, combined with the new iSHELL spectrograph, will yield long-term RV precisions of ≲5 m s-1 in the NIR, which will allow the detection of super-Earths near the habitable zone of mid-M dwarfs.},

abstract = {Using a large sample of optical spectra of late-type dwarfs, we identify a subset of late-M through L field dwarfs that, because of the presence of low-gravity features in their spectra, are believed to be unusually young. From a combined sample of 303 field L dwarfs, we find observationally that 7.6+/-1.6{\%} are younger than 100 Myr. This percentage is in agreement with theoretical predictions once observing biases are taken into account. We find that these young L dwarfs tend to fall in the southern hemisphere (Dec {\textless} 0 deg) and may be previously unrecognized, low-mass members of nearby, young associations like Tucana-Horologium, TW Hydrae, beta Pictoris, and AB Doradus. We use a homogeneously observed sample of roughly one hundred and fifty 6300-10000 Angstrom spectra of L and T dwarfs taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory to examine the strength of the 6708-A Li I line as a function of spectral type and further corroborate the trends noted by Kirkpatrick et al. (2000). We use our low-gravity spectra to investigate the strength of the Li I line as a function of age. The data weakly suggest that for early- to mid-L dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum for a few 100 Myr, whereas for much older (few Gyr) and much younger ({\textless}100 Myr) L dwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. We show that a weakening of lithium at lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effect partially corroborated by existing observational data. Larger samples containing L dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test this empirically. If verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited in Kirkpatrick et al. (2006) that the lithium test should be used with caution when attempting to confirm the substellar nature of the youngest brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {One of the most directly observable features of a transiting multi-planet system is their size-ordering when ranked in orbital separation. Kepler has revealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like Kepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the hypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might reasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes. However, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature, may erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they formed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary system's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighboring planets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain. We derive closed-form solutions for many of the micro state occupancies and provide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to ten-planet systems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property that their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We find that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in entropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for systems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is robust against the possibility of missing planets too. Put together, our work establishes that Kepler systems do indeed remember something of their younger years and highlights the value of information theory for exoplanetary science.},

abstract = {We describe how to generate a longitudinal brightness map for a tidally locked exoplanet from its phase function light curve. We operate under a number of simplifying assumptions, neglecting limb darkening/brightening, star spots, detector ramps, as well as time-variability over a single planetary rotation. We develop the transformation from a planetary brightness map to a phase function light curve and simplify the expression for the case of an edge-on system. We introduce two models--composed of longitudinal slices of uniform brightness, and sinusoidally varying maps, respectively--which greatly simplify the transformation from map to light curve. We discuss numerical approaches to extracting a longitudinal map from a phase function light curve, explaining how to estimate the uncertainty in a computed map and how to choose an appropriate number of fit parameters. We demonstrate these techniques on a simulated map and discuss the uses and limitations of longitudinal maps. The sinusoidal model provides a better fit to the planet's underlying brightness map, although the slice model is more appropriate for light curves which only span a fraction of the planet's orbit. Regardless of which model is used, we find that there is a maximum of {\~{}}5 free parameters which can be meaningfully fit based on a full phase function light curve, due to the insensitivity of the latter to certain modes of the map.},

Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck and HST and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise individual masses spanning 30-115 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}. We determine a model-independent substellar boundary that is {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}70 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} in mass ({\$}\backslashapprox{\$}L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. (2015) evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the substellar mass-luminosity relation and find in the L/T transition only Saumon {\&} Marley (2008) "hybrid" models accounting for cloud clearing match our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and 30-70 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We discover two triple brown dwarf systems, the first with directly measured masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries, possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks. Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

There is indeed considerable overlap in the photospheric temperatures of the coldest brown dwarfs (spectral classes L and T) and the hottest exoplanets. However, the properties and processes associated with brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres can differ significantly in detail; photospheric gas pressures, elemental abundance variations, processes associated with external driving sources, and evolutionary effects are all pertinent examples. In this contribution, I review some of the basic theoretical and empirical properties of the currently known population of brown dwarfs, and detail the similarities and differences between their visible atmospheres and those of extrasolar planets.

abstract = {For the past 400 years, astronomers have sought to observe and interpret the Universe by building more powerful telescopes. These incredible instruments extend the capabilities of one of our most important senses, sight, towards new limits such as increased sensitivity and resolution, new dimensions such as exploration of wavelengths across the full electromagnetic spectrum, new information content such as analysis through spectroscopy, and new cadences such as rapid time-series views of the variable sky. The results from these investments, from small to large telescopes on the ground and in space, have completely transformed our understanding of the Universe; including the discovery that Earth is not the center of the Universe, that the Milky Way is one among many galaxies in the Universe, that relic cosmic background radiation fills all space in the early Universe, that that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating, that exoplanets are common around stars, that gravitational waves exist, and much more. For modern astronomical research, the next wave of breakthroughs in fields ranging over planetary, stellar, galactic, and extragalactic science motivate a general-purpose observatory that is optimized at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and that has much greater sensitivity, resolution, and spectroscopic multiplexing than all previous telescopes. This scientific vision, from measuring the composition of rocky worlds in the nearby Milky Way galaxy to finding the first sources of light in the Universe to other topics at the forefront of modern astrophysics, motivates the state-of-the-art James Webb Space Telescope (Webb). In this review paper, I summarize the design and technical capabilities of Webb and the scientific opportunities that it enables.},

Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are consistent with observations.

abstract = {The relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen is a potent tracer of planet formation and evolution. Jupiter and Saturn have protosolar D/H ratios, a relic of substantial gas accretion from the nebula, while Neptune and Uranus are enhanced in D by accretion of ices into their envelopes. For terrestrial planets, D/H ratios are used to determine the mechanisms of volatile delivery and subsequent atmosphere loss over the lifetime of the planet. Free-floating planets and brown dwarfs more massive than {\~{}}13 M{\_}J quickly fuse their initial D reservoir. Here, we simulate spectra from Teff=200--1800 K including both CH3D and HDO to determine the observability of these dominant deuterium isotopologues in mid-infrared thermal emission spectra. Colder objects have stronger molecular features in their spectra, due to the temperature-dependence of molecular cross sections. CH3D is easier to observe than HDO at all temperatures considered, due to the strength of its absorption bands and locations of features at wavelengths with few other strong absorption features. For objects from 250--450 K closer than 10 pc, a protosolar D/H ratio would be readily observable in 5 hours with JWST. Moderately young Jupiter-mass planets (100--300 Myr) and young Neptunes (10 Myr) may be discovered with JWST and provide the best targets for detecting deuterium on an exoplanet in the coming decade. Future telescope designs should consider the importance of isotopes for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary atmospheres.},

abstract = {Deep optical imaging is used to study time-domain properties of young brown dwarfs in sigma Orionis over typical rotational time-scales and to search for new substellar and planetary-mass cluster members. We used VIMOS at the VLT to monitor a 24 arcmin x 16 arcmin field in the I-band. Using the individual images from this run we investigated the photometric time series of nine substellar cluster members with masses from 10 to 60 Mj. The deep stacked image shows cluster members down to {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 5 Mj. We search for new planetary mass objects by combining our deep I-band photometry with public J-band magnitudes and by examining the nearby environment of known very low mass members for possible companions. We find two brown dwarfs, with significantly variable, aperiodic light curves, both with masses around 50 Mj, one of which was previously unknown to be variable. The physical mechanism responsible for the observed variability is likely different for the two objects. The variability of the first object, a single-lined spectroscopic binary, is most likely linked to its accretion disc, the second may be caused by variable extinction by large grains. We find five new candidate members from the colour-magnitude diagram and three from a search for companions within 2000 au. We rule all eight sources out as potential members based on non-stellar shape and/or infrared colours. The I-band photometry is made available as a public dataset. We present two variable brown dwarfs. One is consistent with ongoing accretion, the other, exhibiting apparent transient variability without presence of an accretion disc. Our analysis confirms the existing census of substellar cluster members down to {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 7 Mj. The zero result from our companion search agrees with the low occurrence rate of wide companions to brown dwarfs found in other works.},

abstract = {The near-infrared colors of the planets directly imaged around the A star HR 8799 are much redder than most field brown dwarfs of the same effective temperature. Previous theoretical studies of these objects have concluded that the atmospheres of planets b, c, and d are unusually cloudy or have unusual cloud properties. Some studies have also found that the inferred radii of some or all of the planets disagree with expectations of standard giant planet evolution models. Here, we compare the available data to the predictions of our own set of atmospheric and evolution models that have been extensively tested against observations of field L and T dwarfs, including the reddest L dwarfs. Unlike some previous studies, we require mutually consistent choices for effective temperature, gravity, cloud properties, and planetary radius. This procedure thus yields plausible values for the masses, effective temperatures, and cloud properties of all three planets. We find that the cloud properties of the HR 8799 planets are not unusual but rather follow previously recognized trends, including a gravity dependence on the temperature of the L to T spectral transition—some reasons for which we discuss. We find that the inferred mass of planet b is highly sensitive to whether or not we include the H- and the K-band spectrum in our analysis. Solutions for planets c and d are consistent with the generally accepted constraints on the age of the primary star and orbital dynamics. We also confirm that, like in L and T dwarfs and solar system giant planets, non-equilibrium chemistry driven by atmospheric mixing is also important for these objects. Given the preponderance of data suggesting that the L to T spectral type transition is gravity dependent, we present an exploratory evolution calculation that accounts for this effect. Finally we recompute the bolometric luminosity of all three planets.},

abstract = {Through a previous analysis of multi-epoch astrometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), I identified WISE J085510.83-071442.5 as a new high proper motion object. By combining astrometry from WISE and the Spitzer Space Telescope, I have measured a proper motion of 8.1+/-0.1"/yr and a parallax of 0.454+/-0.045" (2.20+0.24/-0.20 pc) for WISE J085510.83-071442.5, giving it the third highest proper motion and the fourth largest parallax of any known star or brown dwarf. It is also the coldest known brown dwarf based on its absolute magnitude at 4.5um and its color in [3.6]-[4.5]. By comparing M4.5 with the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, I estimate an effective temperature of 225-260 K and a mass of 3-10 Mjup for the age range of 1-10 Gyr that encompasses most nearby stars.},

abstract = {We present results from a two-night R{\~{}}4000 0.9-2.5 micron spectroscopic monitoring campaign of Luhman 16AB (L7.5 + T0.5). We assess the variability amplitude as a function of pressure level in the atmosphere of Luhman 16B: the more variable of the two components. The amplitude decreases monotonically with decreasing pressure, indicating that the source of variability - most likely patchy clouds - lies in the lower atmosphere. An unexpected result is that the strength of the K I absorption is higher in the faint state of Luhman 16B and lower in the bright state. We conclude that either the abundance of K I increases when the clouds roll in, potentially because of additional K I in the cloud itself, or that the temperature-pressure profile changes. We reproduce the change in K I absorption strengths with combinations of spectral templates to represent the bright and the faint variability states. These are dominated by a warmer L8 or L9 component, with a smaller contribution from a cooler T1 or T2 component. The success of this approach argues that the mechanism responsible for brown dwarf variability is also behind the diverse spectral morphology across the L-to-T transition. We further suggest that the L9-T1 part of the sequence represents a narrow but random ordering of effective temperatures and cloud fractions, obscured by the monotonic progression in methane absorption strength.},

abstract = {We present new JHKL'M' photometry on the MKO system for a large sample of L and T dwarfs identified from SDSS and 2MASS and classified according to the scheme of Geballe et al. (2002). We have compiled a sample of 105 L and T dwarfs that are uniformly classified and measured on a single photometric system. The scattered JHK spectral indices and colors of L dwarfs are likely caused by variations in the altitudes, distributions, and thicknesses of condensate clouds. Scatter in the H-K colors of late T dwarfs probably reflects the sensitivity of the K-band flux to pressure induced H{\_}2 opacity, which itself is sensitive to surface gravity. The M' luminosities of late-T dwarfs are 1.5-2.5 times fainter than predicted under conditions of chemical equilibrium. We have computed L{\_}bol and T{\_}eff for 42 L and T dwarfs whose trigonometric parallaxes have been measured.

abstract = {Directly-imaged planetary-mass companions offer unique opportunities in atmospheric studies of exoplanets. They share characteristics of both brown dwarfs and transiting exoplanets, therefore, are critical for connecting atmospheric characterizations for these objects. Rotational phase mapping is a powerful technique to constrain the condensate cloud properties in ultra-cool atmospheres. Applying this technique to directly-imaged planetary-mass companions will be extremely valuable for constraining cloud models in low mass and surface gravity atmospheres and for determining the rotation rate and angular momentum of substellar companions. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 near-infrared time-resolved photometry for three planetary-mass companions, AB Pic B, 2M0122B, and 2M1207b. Using two-roll differential imaging and hybrid point spread function modeling, we achieve sub-percent photometric precision for all three observations. We find tentative modulations ({\textless}2) for AB Pic B and 2M0122B but cannot reach conclusive results on 2M1207b due to strong systematics. The relatively low significance of the modulation measurements cannot rule out the hypothesis that these planetary-mass companions have the same vertical cloud structures as brown dwarfs. Our rotation rate measurements, combined with archival period measurements of planetary-mass companions and brown dwarfs do not support a universal mass-rotation relation. The high precision of our observations and the high occurrence rates of variable low-surface gravity objects encourage high-contrast time-resolved observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the 0.95-14.5 micron spectral energy distributions of nine field ultracool dwarfs with spectral types ranging from L1 to T4.5. Effective temperatures, gravities, and condensate cloud sedimentation efficiencies are derived by comparing the data to synthetic spectra computed from atmospheric models that self-consistently include the formation of condensate clouds. Derived effective temperatures decrease steadily through the L1 to T4.5 spectral types and we confirm that the effective temperatures of ultracool dwarfs at the L/T transition are nearly constant, decreasing by only {\~{}}200 K from spectral types L7.5 to T4.5. The two objects in our sample with very red J-Ks colors are best fitted with synthetic spectra that have thick clouds which hints at a possible correlation between the near-infrared colors of L dwarfs and the condensate cloud properties. The fits to the two T dwarfs in our sample (T2 and T4.5) also suggest that the clouds become thinner in this spectral class, in agreement with previous studies. Restricting the fits to narrower wavelength ranges (i.e., individual photometric bands) almost always yields excellent agreement between the data and models. Limitations in our knowledge of the opacities of key absorbers such as FeH, VO, and CH4 at certain wavelengths remain obvious, however. The effective temperatures obtained by fitting the narrower wavelength ranges can show a large scatter compared to the values derived by fitting the full spectral energy distributions; deviations are typically {\~{}}200 K and in the worst cases, up to 700 K.},

abstract = {The rapid advances in observations of the different populations of exoplanets, the characterization of their host stars and the links to the properties of their planetary systems, the detailed studies of protoplanetary disks, and the experimental study of the interiors and composition of the massive planets in our solar system provide a firm basis for the next big question in planet formation theory. How do the elemental and chemical compositions of planets connect with their formation? The answer to this requires that the various pieces of planet formation theory be linked together in an end-to-end picture that is capable of addressing these large data sets. In this review, we discuss the critical elements of such a picture and how they affect the chemical and elemental make up of forming planets. Important issues here include the initial state of forming and evolving disks, chemical and dust processes within them, the migration of planets and the importance of planet traps, the nature of angular momentum transport processes involving turbulence and/or MHD disk winds, planet formation theory, and advanced treatments of disk astrochemistry. All of these issues affect, and are affected by the chemistry of disks which is driven by X-ray ionization of the host stars. We discuss how these processes lead to a coherent end-to-end model and how this may address the basic question.},

Quick-MESS uses the (expected) contrast curves for direct imaging surveys to assess for each target the probability that a planet of a given mass and semi-major axis can be detected. By using a grid-based approach Quick-MESS is typically more than an order of magnitude faster than tools based on Monte-Carlo sampling of the planet distribution. In addition, Quick-MESS is extremely flexible, enabling the study of a large range of parameter space for the mass and semi-major axes distributions without the need of re-simulating the planet distribution.

abstract = {Most exoplanets detected by direct imaging so far have been characterized by relatively hot ({\textgreater} {\~{}}1000 K) and cloudy atmospheres. A surprising feature in some of their atmospheres has been a distinct lack of methane, possibly implying non-equilibrium chemistry. Recently, we reported the discovery of a planetary companion to the Sun-like star GJ 504 using Subaru/HiCIAO within the SEEDS survey. The planet is substantially colder ({\textless}600 K) than previously imaged planets, and has indications of fewer clouds, which implies that it represents a new class of planetary atmospheres with expected similarities to late T-type brown dwarfs in the same temperature range. If so, one might also expect the presence of significant methane absorption, which is characteristic of such objects. Here, we report the detection of deep methane absorption in the atmosphere of GJ 504 b, using the Spectral Differential Imaging mode of HiCIAO to distinguish the absorption feature around 1.6 um. We also report updated JHK photometry based on new Ks-band data and a re-analysis of the existing data. The results support the notion that GJ 504 b has atmospheric properties distinct from other imaged exoplanets, and will become a useful reference object for future planets in the same temperature range.},

abstract = {Direct-imaging searches for planets reveal wide orbit planets amenable to spectroscopy, and their atmospheres represent an important comparison to the irradiated atmospheres of Hot Jupiters. Using AO integral field spectroscopy of 2M1207 b, the shape of the continuum emission over the J, H, and K bands from the atmosphere of this young, planetary mass companion is measured in order to compare with atmospheric and evolutionary models, and objects of similar temperature in young clusters and the field. The 2M1207 b spectrum has the highest spectral resolution (R{\~{}}300-1500) and largest wavelength coverage, including the first J-band spectrum, for this benchmark object. The high signal-to-noise of the data allow a clear identification of signatures of low surface gravity, and comparison with a grid of AMES-Dusty models reveals a best-fit effective temperature of Teff=1600 K with a preferred surface gravity of log g=4.5. The J-band flux is depressed relative to nearly all L-type objects, and the detailed shape of the absorption features across the H-band exhibit differences from the model predictions. The possible origins of 2M1207 b and its low luminosity are examined with the new data and analysis which suggest that extinction from a disk with large grains is a viable scenario and is preferred over scatttering off an optically thick disk. The 2M1207 b spectrum presents an important comparison for the types of features which may be present in upcoming spectra of the atmospheres of planets imaged in orbit around stellar primaries.},

abstract = {Variability in the light curves of spotted, rotating stars is often non-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic --- spots move on the stellar surface and have finite lifetimes, causing stellar flux variations to slowly shift in phase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a rotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces have many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate effective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel function. This highly flexible model allows sampling of the posterior probability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalising over the other kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test the effectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated stellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces periods that are more accurate than both a sine-fitting periodogram and an autocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real data, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously measured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these 1132 Kepler objects of interest and their posterior probability density function samples. Because this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will enable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those involving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in exoplanet systems, or characterising star-planet interactions. The code used to implement this method is available online.},

Specifically, we use an established set of spectral indices to determine surface gravity classifications for all M6-L7 objects in our sample by measuring equivalent widths (EW) of the K I lines at 1.1692, 1.1778, 1.2529 um, and the 1.2 um FeHJ absorption index. Our results are consistent with previous surface gravity measurements, showing a distinct double peak - at {\~{}}L5 and T5 - in K I EW as a function of spectral type. We analyze K I EWs of 73 objects of known ages and find a linear trend between log(Age) and EW. From this relationship, we assign age ranges to the very low gravity, intermediate gravity, and field gravity designations for spectral types M6-L0. Interestingly, the ages probed by these designations remain broad, change with spectral type, and depend on the gravity sensitive index used. Gravity designations are useful indicators of the possibility of youth, but current datasets cannot be used to provide a precise age estimate.},

abstract = {Exoplanet surveys have confirmed one of humanity's (and all teenagers') worst fears: we are weird. If our Solar System were observed with present-day Earth technology -- to put our system and exoplanets on the same footing -- Jupiter is the only planet that would be detectable. The statistics of exo-Jupiters indicate that the Solar System is unusual at the {\~{}}1{\%} level among Sun-like stars (or {\~{}}0.1{\%} among all stars). But why are we different? Successful formation models for both the Solar System and exoplanet systems rely on two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instability. Systems of close-in super-Earths or sub-Neptunes require substantial radial inward motion of solids either as drifting mm- to cm-sized pebbles or migrating Earth-mass or larger planetary embryos. We argue that, regardless of their formation mode, the late evolution of super-Earth systems involves migration into chains of mean motion resonances, generally followed by instability when the disk dissipates. This pattern is likely also ubiquitous in giant planet systems. We present three models for inner Solar System formation -- the low-mass asteroid belt, Grand Tack, and Early Instability models -- each invoking a combination of migration and instability. We identify bifurcation points in planetary system formation. We present a series of events to explain why our Solar System is so weird. Jupiter's core must have formed fast enough to quench the growth of Earth's building blocks by blocking the flux of inward-drifting pebbles. The large Jupiter/Saturn mass ratio is rare among giant exoplanets but may be required to maintain Jupiter's wide orbit. The giant planets' instability must have been gentle, with no close encounters between Jupiter and Saturn, also unusual in the larger (exoplanet) context. Our Solar System system is thus the outcome of multiple unusual, but not unheard of, events.},

During an ongoing survey of 5'×5' fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with the Infrared Array Camera aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we identified these companions as candidate T dwarfs based on their mid-infrared colors. Using near-infrared spectra obtained with SpeX at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, we confirm the presence of methane absorption that characterizes T dwarfs and measure spectral types of T2.5+/-0.5 and T7.5+/-0.5 for HN Peg B and HD 3651B, respectively. By comparing our Spitzer data to images from the Two Micron All Sky Survey obtained several years earlier, we find that the proper motions of HN Peg B and HD 3651B are consistent with those of the primaries, confirming their companionship. A comparison of their luminosities to the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of 0.021+/-0.009 and 0.051+/-0.014 Msolar for HN Peg B and HD 3651B, respectively. In addition, the models imply an effective temperature for HN Peg B that is significantly lower than the values derived for other T dwarfs at similar spectral types, which is the same behavior reported by Metchev {\&} Hillenbrand for the young late L dwarf HD 203030B. Thus, the temperature of the L/T transition appears to depend on surface gravity. Meanwhile, HD 3651B is the first substellar companion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-in planet from radial velocity surveys. The discovery of this companion supports the notion that the high eccentricities of close-in planets like that near HD 3651 may be the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.},

abstract = {The atmospheres of substellar objects contain clouds of oxides, iron, silicates, and other refractory condensates. Water clouds are expected in the coolest objects. The opacity of these `dust' clouds strongly affects both the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile and the emergent flux. Thus any attempt to model the spectra of these atmospheres must incorporate a cloud model. However the diversity of cloud models in atmospheric simulations is large and it is not always clear how the underlying physics of the various models compare. Likewise the observational consequences of different modeling approaches can be masked by other model differences, making objective comparisons challenging. In order to clarify the current state of the modeling approaches, this paper compares five different cloud models in two sets of tests. Test case 1 tests the dust cloud models for a prescribed L, L--T, and T-dwarf atmospheric (temperature T, pressure p, convective velocity vconv)-structures. Test case 2 compares complete model atmosphere results for given (effective temperature Teff, surface gravity log g). All models agree on the global cloud structure but differ in opacity-relevant details like grain size, amount of dust, dust and gas-phase composition. Comparisons of synthetic photometric fluxes translate into an modelling uncertainty in apparent magnitudes for our L-dwarf (T-dwarf) test case of 0.25 {\textless} $\backslash$Delta m {\textless} 0.875 (0.1 {\textless} $\backslash$Delta m M 1.375) taking into account the 2MASS, the UKIRT WFCAM, the Spitzer IRAC, and VLT VISIR filters with UKIRT WFCAM being the most challenging for the models.

The size of our star sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of the frequency of systems shows that more than 50{\%} of solar-type stars harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days. Different properties are observed for the population of planets less massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets (SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About 14{\%} of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than 50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun vicinity is achieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered planets are announced in the Appendix of this paper, among which 15 Super-Earths.},

abstract = {The target of many astronomical studies is the recovery of tiny astrophysical signals living in a sea of uninteresting (but usually dominant) noise. In many contexts (i.e., stellar time-series, or high-contrast imaging, or stellar spectroscopy), there are structured components in this noise caused by systematic effects in the astronomical source, the atmosphere, the telescope, or the detector. More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for these nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many (unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference. Sometimes, housekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can be used as predictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple functions of these predictors are often used as computationally tractable models that can capture the nuisances. These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics prior to investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a simultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that if a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the weights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which can (often) be made fast. We illustrate this model by demonstrating the applicability of a linear model for the non-linear systematics in K2 time-series data, where the dominant noise source for many stars is spacecraft motion and variability.},

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) observations of a sample of 134 ultracool objects (spectral types later than M7) coming from the Deep Near Infrared Survey (DENIS), Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with distances estimated to range from 7 to 105 pc. Fifteen new ultracool binary candidates are reported here. Eleven known binaries are confirmed, and orbital motion is detected in some of them. We estimate that the closest binary systems in this sample have periods between 5 and 20 yr, and thus dynamical masses will be derived in the near future. For the calculation of binary frequency, we restrict ourselves to systems with distances less than 20 pc. After correction of the binaries bias, we find a ratio of visual binaries (at the HST limit of detection) of around 10{\%}, and that {\~{}}15{\%} of the 26 objects within 20 pc are binary systems with separations between 1 and 8 AU. The observed frequency of ultracool binaries is similar to that of binaries with G-type primaries in the separation range from 2.1 to 140 AU. There is also a clear deficit of ultracool binaries with separations greater than 15 AU, and a possible tendency for the binaries to have mass ratios near unity. Most systems have indeed visual and near-infrared brightness ratios between 1 and 0.3. We discuss our results in the framework of current scenarios for the formation and evolution of free-floating brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {The atmosphere of a brown dwarf or extrasolar giant planet controls the spectrum of radiation emitted by the object and regulates its cooling over time. Although the study of these atmospheres has been informed by decades of experience modeling stellar and planetary atmospheres, the distinctive characteristics of these objects present unique challenges to forward modeling. In particular, complex chemistry arising from molecule-rich atmospheres, molecular opacity line lists (sometimes running to 10 billion absorption lines or more), multiple cloud-forming condensates, and disequilibrium chemical processes all combine to create a challenging task for any modeling effort. This review describes the process of incorporating these complexities into one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models of substellar objects. We discuss the underlying mathematics as well as the techniques used to model the physics, chemistry, radiative transfer, and other processes relevant to understanding these atmospheres. T...},

We use the BANYAN II Bayesian inference tool to show that both objects are candidate members to TWA with a very low probability of being field contaminants, although the kinematics of J1247-3816 seem slightly at odds with that of other TWA members. J1207-3900 is currently the latest-type and the only isolated L-type candidate member of TWA. Measuring the distance and radial velocity of both objects is still required to claim them as bona fide members. Such late-type objects are predicted to have masses down to 11-15 MJup at the age of TWA, which makes them compelling targets to study atmospheric properties in a regime similar to that of currently known imaged extrasolar planets.},

abstract = {We present a new and computationally efficient method for characterizing very low mass companions using low resolution ({\$}R\backslashsim{\$}30) near-infrared ({\$}YJH{\$}) spectra from high contrast imaging campaigns with integral field spectrograph (IFS) units. We conduct a detailed quantitative comparison of the efficacy of this method through tests on simulated data comparable in spectral coverage and resolution to the currently operating direct imaging systems around the world. In particular, we simulate Project 1640 data as an example of the use, accuracy, and precision of this technique. We present results from comparing simulated spectra of M, L, and T dwarfs with a large and finely-sampled grid of synthetic spectra using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. We determine the precision and accuracy of effective temperature and surface gravity inferred from fits to PHOENIX dusty and cond, which we find reproduce the low-resolution spectra of all objects within the adopted flux uncertainties. Uncertainties in effective temperature decrease from {\$}\backslashpm{\$}100-500 K for M dwarfs to as small as {\$}\backslashpm{\$}30 K for some L and T spectral types. Surface gravity is constrained to within 0.2-0.4 dex for mid-L through T dwarfs, but uncertainties are as large as 1.0 dex or more for M dwarfs. Results for effective temperature from low-resolution {\$}YJH{\$} spectra generally match predictions from published spectral type-temperature relationships except for L-T transition objects and young objects. Single-band spectra (i.e., narrower wavelength coverage) result in larger uncertainties and often discrepant results, suggesting that high contrast IFS observing campaigns can compensate for low spectral resolution by expanding the wavelength coverage for reliable characterization of detected companions.

This allows us to confirm the theoretically anticipated minimum in radius between stars and brown dwarfs across the hydrogen burning minimum mass. We find the minimum occurs between L2 and L6 and verify the predicted steep dependence of radius in the hydrogen burning regime and the gentle rise into the degenerate brown dwarf regime.

Spectra of these objects not only depend upon their mass and effective temperature, but also their atmospheric chemistry, weather, and dynamics. As a consequence divining their mass, metallicity and age solely from their spectra has been a challenge. JWST, by illuminating spectral blind spots and observing objects with constrained masses and ages should finally unearth a sufficient number of ultracool dwarf Rosetta Stones to allow us to decipher the processes underlying the complex brown dwarf cooling sequence. In addition the spectra of objects invisible from the ground, including very low mass objects in clusters and nearby cold dwarfs from the disk population, will be seen for the first time.

abstract = {Context: Low-mass stars and extrasolar planets have ultra-cool atmospheres where a rich chemistry occurs and clouds form. The increasing amount of spectroscopic observations for extrasolar planets requires self-consistent model atmosphere simulations to consistently include the formation processes that determine cloud formation and their feedback onto the atmosphere. Aims: Complement the MARCS model atmosphere suit with simulations applicable to low-mass stars and exoplanets in preparation of E-ELT, JWST, PLATO and other upcoming facilities. Methods: The MARCS code calculates stellar atmosphere models, providing self-consistent solutions of the radiative transfer and the atmospheric structure and chemistry. We combine MARCS with DRIFT, a kinetic model that describes cloud formation in ultra-cool atmospheres (seed formation, growth/ evaporation, gravitational settling, convective mixing, element depletion). Results: We present a small grid of self-consistently calculated atmosphere models for {\$}T{\_} \backslashtext{\{}eff{\}} = 2000 - 3000{\$} K with solar initial abundances and {\$}\backslashlog(g) = 4.5{\$}. Cloud formation in stellar and sub-stellar atmospheres appears for {\$}T{\_}\backslashtext{\{}eff{\}} {\textless} 2700{\$} K and has a significant effect on the structure and the spectrum of the atmosphere for {\$}T{\_}\backslashtext{\{}eff{\}} {\textless} 2400{\$} K. We have compared the synthetic spectra of our models with observed spectra and found that they fit the spectra of mid to late type M-dwarfs and early type L-dwarfs well. We also test DRIFT-MARCS for an example exoplanet and demonstrate that our simulations reproduce the Spitzer observations for WASP-19b rather well for {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}=2600{\$} K, {\$}\backslashlog(g)=3.2{\$} and solar abundances. Our model points at an exoplanet with a deep cloud-free atmosphere with a substantial day-night energy transport and no temperature inversion.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of 87 new T dwarfs uncovered with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and three brown dwarfs with extremely red near-infrared colors that exhibit characteristics of both L and T dwarfs. Two of the new T dwarfs are likely binaries with L7+/-1 primaries and mid-type T secondaries. In addition, our follow-up program has confirmed 10 previously identified T dwarfs and four photometrically-selected L and T dwarf candidates in the literature. This sample, along with the previous WISE discoveries, triples the number of known brown dwarfs with spectral types later than T5. Using the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog we present updated color-color and color-type diagrams for all the WISE-discovered T and Y dwarfs. Near-infrared spectra of the new discoveries are presented, along with spectral classifications. To accommodate later T dwarfs we have modified the integrated flux method of determining spectral indices to instead use the median flux. Furthermore, a newly defined J-narrow index differentiates the early-type Y dwarfs from late-type T dwarfs based on the J-band continuum slope. The K/J indices for this expanded sample show that 32{\%} of late-type T dwarfs have suppressed K-band flux and are blue relative to the spectral standards, while only 11{\%} are redder than the standards. Comparison of the Y/J and K/J index to models suggests diverse atmospheric conditions and supports the possible re-emergence of clouds after the L/T transition. We also discuss peculiar brown dwarfs and candidates that were found not to be substellar, including two Young Stellar Objects and two Active Galactic Nuclei. The coolest WISE-discovered brown dwarfs are the closest of their type and will remain the only sample of their kind for many years to come.},

abstract = {Recent photometric studies have revealed that surface spots that produce flux variations are present on virtually all L and T dwarfs. Their likely magnetic or dusty nature has been a much-debated problem, the resolution to which has been hindered by paucity of diagnostic multi-wavelength observations. To test for a correlation between magnetic activity and photometric variability, we searched for H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission among eight L3{\$}-{\$}T2 ultra-cool dwarfs with extensive previous photometric monitoring, some of which are known to be variable at 3.6 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m or 4.5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. We detected H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} only in the non-variable T2 dwarf 2MASS J12545393{\$}-{\$}0122474. The remaining seven objects do not show H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission, even though six of them are known to vary photometrically. Combining our results with those for 86 other L and T dwarfs from the literature show that the detection rate of H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission is very high (94{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) for spectral types between L0 and L3.5 and much smaller (20{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) for spectral types {\$}\backslashge{\$}L4, while the detection rate of photometric variability is approximately constant (30{\$}\backslash{\%}-{\$}55{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) from L0 to T8 dwarfs. We conclude that chromospheric activity, as evidenced by H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission, and large-amplitude photometric variability are not correlated. Consequently, dust clouds are the dominant driver of the observed variability of ultra-cool dwarfs at spectral types at least as early as L0.},

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {(Abridged) Highly unequal-mass ratio binaries are rare among field brown dwarfs, with the known census described by q (4.9+/-0.7). However, such systems can test the joint accuracy of evolutionary and atmospheric models, under the constraint of coevality (the "isochrone test''). We carry out this test using two of the most extreme field substellar binaries currently known, the T1+T6 eps Ind Bab binary and a newly discovered 0.14" T2.0+T7.5 binary, 2MASS 1209-10AB. Based on the locations of the components on the H-R diagram, models successfully indicate that the systems are coeval, with internal age differences of log(age) = 0.5+0.4-0.3 and -0.8+/-1.3 dex, respectively. However, the total mass of eps Ind Bab derived from the H-R diagram ({\~{}}80 Mjup) is discrepant with the reported dynamical mass. This problem, which is independent of the assumed age of the system, can be explained by a {\~{}}50-100 K systematic error in the model atmosphere fitting; bringing the two mass determinations into consistency leads to an inferred age of {\~{}}6 Gyr for the eps Ind system, older than previously assumed. Overall, the two T dwarf binaries studied here, along with recent results from T dwarfs in age and mass benchmark systems, yield evidence for small ({\~{}}100 K) errors in the evolutionary models and/or model atmospheres, but not significantly larger. Finally, the binary nature of 2MASS 1209-10AB reduces its utility as the primary T3 near-IR spectral typing standard; we suggest SDSS 1206+28 as a replacement.},

The directly imaged exoplanet or brown dwarf companion joins a small but growing ensemble of wide-orbit sub-stellar companions with a spin measurement.

abstract = {I have undertaken a comprehensive statistical investigation of the ultracool dwarf companion distribution (spectral typeM6and later). Utilizing a Bayesian algorithm, I tested models of the companion distribution against data from an extensive set of space and ground-based imaging observations of nearby ultracool dwarfs. My main conclusions are fivefold: (1) confirm that the concentration of high mass ratio ultracool binary systems is a fundamental feature of the companion distribution, not an observational or selection bias; (2) determine that the wide ({\textgreater}20 AU) binary fre- quency can be no more than 1{\%}Y2{\%}; (3) show that the decreasing binary frequency with later spectral types is a real trend; (4) demonstrate that a large population of currently undetected low mass ratio systems are not consistent with the current data; and (5) find that the population of spectroscopic binaries must be at least 30{\%}that of currently known ultracool binaries. The best-fit value for the overall M6 and later binary frequency is20{\%}Y22{\%}, of which only6{\%} consists of currently undetected companionswith separations less than 1AU. If this is correct, then the upper limit of the ultracool binary population discovered to date is75{\%}. I find that the numerical simulation results of the ejection for- mation method are inconsistent with the outcome of this analysis. However, dynamics do seem to play an important role, as simulations of small-N clusters and triple system decays produce results similar to those of this work. The observational efforts required to improve these constraints are shown to be primarily large spectroscopic binary sur- veys and improved high-resolution imaging techniques.},

In the first 371 deg{\^{}}2 of actual 2MASS survey data, we have identified another 20 such objects spectroscopically confirmed using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Because the TiO and VO bands, which dominate the far-optical portions of late-M spectra, disappear in these cooler dwarfs, we define a new spectral class L'' in which metallic oxides are replaced by metallic hydrides and neutral alkali metals as the major spectroscopic signatures. We establish classification indices and type all 25 L dwarfs. The 26th post-M9.5'' object-Gl 229B-is the prototype of a methane-dominated spectral class, which we propose as class T.'' At least five of the 20 2MASS L dwarfs show the 6708 {\{}{\AA}{\}} lithium doublet at low resolution, the strongest having an equivalent width of 18.5 {\{}{\AA}{\}}. For objects this cool, the presence of lithium proves that they are substellar. Two other 2MASS objects appear to have lithium lines at the limit of our detectability, which if verified means that at least one-third of our L dwarfs are bona fide brown dwarfs.

This sample includes 79 new candidate young brown dwarfs and 22 planetary-mass objects. These candidates were identified through the first systematic all-sky survey for late-type low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in YMGs. We cross-matched the 2MASS and ALLWISE catalogs outside of the galactic plane to build a sample of 98 970 potential {\$}\backslashgeq{\$} M5 dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and calculated their proper motions with typical precisions of 5-15 mas yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. We selected highly probable candidate members of several YMGs from this sample using the Bayesian Analysis for Nearby Young AssociatioNs II tool (BANYAN II). We used the most probable statistical distances inferred from BANYAN II to estimate the spectral type and mass of these candidate YMG members. We used this unique sample to show tentative signs of mass segregation in the AB Doradus moving group and the Tucana-Horologium and Columba associations. The BASS sample has already been successful in identifying several new young brown dwarfs in earlier publications, and will be of great interest in studying the initial mass function of YMGs and for the search of exoplanets by direct imaging; the input sample of potential close-by {\$}\backslashgeq{\$} M5 dwarfs will be useful to study the kinematics of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs and search for new proper motion pairs.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is the identification of young ({\$}1{\textless} age {\textless} 100{\$} Myr), nearby ({\$}d \backslashleqslant100{\$} pc) moving groups (YNMGs) through their kinematic signature. YNMGs could be the result of the recent dispersal of young embedded clusters, such that they still represent kinematically cold groups, carrying the residual motion of their parental cloud. Using the fact that a large number ({\$}\backslashsim{\$} 14000) of the RAVE sources with evidence of chromospheric activity, also present signatures of stellar youth, we selected a sample of solar type sources with the highest probability of chromospheric activity to look for common kinematics. We made use of radial velocity information from RAVE and astrometric parameters from GAIA DR2 to construct a 6-dimension position-velocity vector catalog for our full sample. We developed a method based on the grouping of stars with similar orientation of their velocity vectors, which we call the Cone Method Sampling. Using this method, we detected 646 sources with high significance in the velocity space, with respect to the average orientation of artificial distributions made from a purely Gaussian velocity ellipsoid with null vertex deviation. We compared this sample of highly significant sources with a catalog of YNMGs reported in previous studies, which yield 75 confirmed members. From the remaining sample, about 50{\%} of the sources have ages younger than 100 Myr, which indicate they are highly probable candidates to be new members of identified or even other YNMGs in the solar neighborhood.},

abstract = {Results from a series of simulations of unforced turbulence evolving within a shallow layer of fluid on a rotating sphere are presented. Simulations show that the turbulent evolution in the spherical domain is strongly dependent on numerical and physical conditions. The independent effects of (1) (hyper)dissipation and initial spectrum, (2) rotation rate, and (3) Rossby deformation radius are carefully isolated and studied in detail. In the nondivergent and nonrotating case, an initially turbulent flow evolves into a vorticity quadrupole at long times, a direct consequence of angular momentum conservation. In the presence of sufficiently strong rotation, the nondivergent long‐time behavior yields a field dominated by polar vortices---as previously reported by Yoden and Yamada. In contrast, the case with a finite deformation radius (i.e., the full spherical shallow‐water system) spontaneously evolves toward a banded configuration, the number of bands increasing with the rotation rate. A direct application of this shallow‐water model to the Jovian atmosphere is discussed. Using standard values for the planetary radius and rotation, we show how the initially turbulent flow self‐organizes into a potential vorticity field containing zonal structures, where regions of steep potential vorticity gradients (jets) separate relatively homogenized bands. Moreover, Jovian parameter values in our simulations lead to a strong vorticity asymmetry, favoring anticyclonic vortices---in further agreement with observations.},

Sixteen of these 25 objects have additional spectral coverage from 0.96-1.14 microns to provide overlap with optical spectra. Spectral flux ratio indexes for prominent molecular bands are derived and equivalent widths (EWs) for several atomic lines are measured. We find that a combination of four H2O and two CH4 band strengths can be used for spectral classification.

abstract = {Growing observational evidence has suggested active meteorology in atmospheres of brown dwarfs (BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-IR brightness variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings of atmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous studies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this work, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a self-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing, cloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in both temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and directly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are one to tens of hours with typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of Kelvins in effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to model parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important implications for the observed flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs, especially those evolve in short timescales. It is also a promising mechanism for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L/T transition of brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {We report on the results of an I-band photometric variability survey of 18 L dwarfs. We find that seven exhibit statistically significant variations above the 95.4{\%} confidence level with rms scatter (including photometric errors) between 0.010 and 0.083 mag. Another five targets have variability probabilities {\~{}}80{\%}, suggesting that these are likely variable objects. Two objects display significant peaks in a CLEAN periodogram that are several times higher than the noise. The periods found for 2MASS 0746+20AB and 2MASS 1300+19 are longer than those periods likely from rotation velocity measurements, and they do not represent periodic behavior in the light curve that persists through the entire data set. These observations suggest that we are not observing the rotation modulation of a long-lived albedo feature. Instead, rapid evolution of atmospheric features is likely causing the nonperiodic variability. The remaining variable objects show no prominent features in their light curves, suggesting even more rapid evolution of atmospheric features. We argue against the existence of magnetic spots in these atmospheres and favor the idea that nonuniform condensate coverage is responsible for these variations. The magnetic Reynolds number in the atmospheres of L dwarfs is too small to support the formation of magnetic spots. In contrast, silicate and iron clouds are expected to form in the photospheres of L dwarfs. Inhomogeneities in such cloud decks and the evolution of the inhomogeneities can plausibly produce the observed photometric variations.},

The spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorption on the blue wing of the H-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to NH{\$}{\_}3{\$}. These spectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between the T dwarfs and the Y dwarfs. In order to produce a smooth near-infrared spectral sequence across the T/Y dwarf transition, we have reclassified UGPS J0722-0540 as the T9 spectral standard and tentatively assign WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 as the Y0 spectral standard. In total, six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classified as Y dwarfs: four are classified as Y0, one is classified as Y0 (pec?), and WISEP J1828+2650 is classified as {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}Y0.

abstract = {The WFCAM Transit Survey (WTS) is a near-infrared transit survey running on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), designed to discover planets around M dwarfs. The WTS acts as a poor-seeing backup programme for the telescope, and represents the first dedicated wide-field near-infrared transit survey. In this paper we describe the observing strategy of the WTS and the processing of the data to generate lightcurves. We describe the basic properties of our photometric data, and measure our sensitivity based on 950 observations. We show that the photometry reaches a precision of {\~{}}4mmag for the brightest unsaturated stars in lightcurves spanning almost 3 years. Optical (SDSS griz) and near-infrared (UKIRT ZYJHK) photometry is used to classify the target sample of 4600 M dwarfs with J magnitudes in the range 11-17. Most have spectral-types in the range M0-M2. We conduct Monte Carlo transit injection and detection simulations for short period ({\textless}10 day) Jupiter- and Neptune-sized planets to characterize the sensitivity of the survey. We investigate the recovery rate as a function of period and magnitude for 4 hypothetical star-planet cases: M0-2+Jupiter, M2-4+Jupiter, M0-2+Neptune, M2-4+Neptune. We find that the WTS lightcurves are very sensitive to the presence of Jupiter-sized short-period transiting planets around M dwarfs. Hot Neptunes produce a much weaker signal and suffer a correspondingly smaller recovery fraction. Neptunes can only be reliably recovered with the correct period around the rather small sample ({\~{}}100) of the latest M dwarfs (M4-M9) in the WTS. The non-detection of a hot-Jupiter around an M dwarf by the WFCAM Transit Survey allows us to place an upper limit of 1.7-2.0 per cent (at 95 per cent confidence) on the planet occurrence rate.},

abstract = {ADI and SDI are well-established high-contrast imaging techniques, but their application is challenging for companions at small angular separations. The aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent adaptive-optics assisted, medium-resolution (R{\$}\backslashsim{\$}5000) integral field spectrographs (IFS) can be used to directly detect the absorption of molecular species in the spectra of planets and substellar companions when these are not present in the spectrum of the star. We analyzed archival data of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pictoris taken with the SINFONI integral field spectrograph (VLT), originally taken to image {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic b using ADI techniques. At each spatial position in the field, a scaled instance of the stellar spectrum is subtracted from the data after which the residuals are cross-correlated with model spectra. The cross-correlation co-adds the individual absorption lines of the planet emission spectrum constructively, but not residual telluric and stellar features. Cross-correlation with CO and H{\$}{\_}2{\$}O models results in significant detections of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic b at SNRs of 14.5 and 17.0 respectively. Correlation with a 1700K BT-Settl model provides a signal with an SNR of 25.0. This contrasts with ADI, which barely reveals the planet. While the AO system only achieved modest Strehl ratios of 19-27{\%} leading to a raw contrast of 1:240 at the planet position, cross-correlation achieves a 3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} contrast limit of {\$}2.5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} in this 2.5h data set {\$}0.36"{\$} away from the star. AO-assisted, medium-resolution IFS such as SINFONI (VLT) and OSIRIS (Keck), can be used for high-contrast imaging utilizing cross-correlation techniques for planets that are close to their star and embedded in speckle noise. We refer to this method as molecule mapping, and advocate its application to observations with future medium resolution instruments, in particular ERIS (VLT), HARMONI (ELT) and NIRSpec and MIRI (JWST).},

The CH4 bands centered at 2.2, 3.3, and 7.65 $\mu$m and the CO band at 2.3 $\mu$m are sensitive to Kzz , and indicates that chemical mixing is important in all L and T dwarf atmospheres. The sample of L3.5 to T5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 Kgsim T eff gsim1000 K, with an L-T transition (spectral types L7 to T4) that lies between 1400 and 1100 K for dwarfs with typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 K warmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. When using optical spectral types, the bluer dwarfs have more typical T eff values as they tend to have earlier optical spectral types. In this model analysis, f sed increases rapidly between types T0 and T4, indicating that increased sedimentation can explain the rapid disappearance of clouds at this stage of brown dwarf evolution. There is a suggestion that the transition to dust-free atmospheres happens at lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.},

We identify 32 new F0-M3-type bona fide members of the 10-200 Myr-old Sco-Cen, Carina, Tucana-Horologium, Columba and Octans associations and the AB Doradus, {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pictoris and Carina-Near moving groups. These new bona fide members have measurements of their full kinematics and literature data consistent with a young age. We also confirm the membership of 66 previously known candidate members using their Gaia-Tycho trigonometric distances or new literature radial velocities, and identify 219 additional new candidate members, most of which do not yet have a radial velocity measurement. This work is the first step towards a completeness-corrected survey of young association members based on Gaia-DR2 in the near future.},

abstract = {At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1 consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of {\~{}}3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of {\~{}}0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of {\~{}}94000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is {\~{}}10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to {\~{}}0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

abstract = {We report proper-motion measurements for 427 late-type M, L, and T dwarfs, 332 of which have been measured for the first time. Combining these new proper motions with previously published measurements yields a sample of 841 M7-T8 dwarfs. We combined parallax measurements or calculated spectrophotometric distances, and computed tangential velocities for the entire sample. We find that kinematics for the full and volume-limited 20 pc samples are consistent with those expected for the Galactic thin disk, with no significant differences between late-type M, L, and T dwarfs. Applying an age–velocity relation we conclude that the average kinematic age of the 20 pc sample of ultracool dwarfs is older than recent kinematic estimates and more consistent with age results calculated with population synthesis models. There is a statistically distinct population of high tangential velocity sources (V tan {\textgreater} 100 km s −1) whose kinematics suggest an even older population of ultracool dwarfs belonging to either the Galactic thick disk or halo. We isolate subsets of the entire sample, including low surface gravity dwarfs, unusually blue L dwarfs, and photometric outliers in J − K s color and investigate their kinematics. We find that the spectroscopically distinct class of unusually blue L dwarfs has kinematics clearly consistent with old age, implying that high surface gravity and/or low metallicity may be relevant to their spectral properties. The low surface gravity dwarfs are kinematically younger than the overall population, and the kinematics of the red and blue ultracool dwarfs suggest ages that are younger and older than the full sample, respectively. We also present a reduced proper-motion diagram at 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) K s for the entire population and find that a limit of H K s {\textgreater} 18 excludes M dwarfs from the L and T dwarf population regardless of near-infrared color, potentially enabling the identification of the coldest brown dwarfs in the absence of color information.},

abstract = {The aim of the project is to characterise both components of the nearest brown dwarf sytem to the Sun, WISE J104915.57-531906.1 (=Luhman16AB) at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. We obtained high signal-to-noise intermediate-resolution (R{\~{}}6000-11000) optical (600-1000 nm) and near-infrared (1000-2480nm) spectra of each component of Luhman16AB, the closest brown dwarf binary to the Sun, with the X-Shooter instrument on the Very Large Telescope. We classify the primary and secondary of the Luhman16 system as L6-L7.5 and T0+/-1, respectively, in agreement with previous measurements published in the literature. We present measurements of the lithium pseudo-equivalent widths, which appears of similar strength on both components (8.2+/-1.0 Angstroms and 8.4+/-1.5 Angstroms for the L and T components, respectively). The presence of lithium (Lithium 7) in both components imply masses below 0.06 Msun while comparison with models suggests lower limits of 0.04 Msun. The detection of lithium in the T component is the first of its kind. Similarly, we assess the strength of other alkali lines (e.g. pseudo-equivalent widths of 6-7 Angstroms for RbI and 4-7 Angstroms for CsI) present in the optical and near-infrared regions and compare with estimates for L and T dwarfs. We also derive effective temperatures and luminosities of each component of the binary: -4.66+/-0.08 dex and 1305(+180)(-135) for the L dwarf and -4.68+/-0.13 dex and 1320(+185)(-135) for the T dwarf, respectively. Using our radial velocity determinations, the binary does not appear to belong to any of the well-known moving group. Our preliminary theoretical analysis of the optical and J-band spectra indicates that the L- and T-type spectra can be reproduced with a single temperature and gravity but different relative chemical abundances which impact strongly the spectral energy distribution of L/T transition objects.},

abstract = {We report radial velocities for 844 FGKM-type main sequence and subgiant stars and 45 K giants, most of which had either low-precision velocity measurements or none at all. These velocities differ from the standard stars of Udry et al. by 0.035 km/s (RMS) for the 26 FGK standard stars in common. The zero-point of our velocities differs from that of Udry et al.: (V{\_}present - V{\_}Udry) = +0.053 km/s. Thus these new velocities agree with the best known standard stars both in precision and zero-point, to well within 0.1 km/s. Nonetheless, both these velocities and the standards suffer from three sources of systematic error, namely, convective blueshift, gravitational redshift, and spectral type mismatch of the reference spectrum. These systematic errors are here forced to be zero for G2V stars by using the Sun as reference, with Vesta and day sky as proxies. But for spectral types departing from solar, the systematic errors reach 0.3 km/s in the F and K stars and 0.4 km/s in M dwarfs. Multiple spectra were obtained for all 889 stars during four years, and 782 of them exhibit velocity scatter less than 0.1 km/s. These stars may serve as radial velocity standards if they remain constant in velocity. We found 11 new spectroscopic binaries and report orbital parameters for them.},

@article{Ruffio2018,
abstract = {Rigorously quantifying the information in high contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and 2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.},

abstract = {A direct image of an exoplanet system is a snapshot of the planets and isk around a central star. We can estimate the orbit of a planet from a time series of images, and we can estimate the size, temperature, clouds, atmospheric gases, surface properties, rotation rate, and likelihood of life on a planet form its photometry, colors, and spectra in the visible and infrared. The exoplanets around stars in the solar neighborhood are expected to be bright enough for us to characterize them with direct imaging; however, they are much fainter than their parent star, and separated by very small angles, so conventional imaging techniques are totally inadequate, and new methods are needed. A direct-imaging instrument for exoplanet must (1) suppress the bright star's image and diffraction pattern, and (2) suppress the star's scattered light from imperfections in the telescope. This chapter shows how exoplanets can be imaged by controlling diffraction with a coronagraph or interferometer, and controlling scattered light with deformable mirrors.},

abstract = {We have derived a new age estimate for the nearby young star AB Dor and have investigated the resulting implications for testing theoretical evolutionary models with the data reported by Close and coworkers for the low-mass companion AB Dor C. Using color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the AB Dor moving group is roughly coeval with the Pleiades ($\tau$ = 100-125 Myr) and is clearly older than IC 2391 ($\tau$ = 35-50 Myr). In fact, based on a comparison of the kinematics of AB Dor and the Pleiades, we suggest that the stars identified by Zuckerman and coworkers as members of a moving group with AB Dor are remnants of the large-scale star-formation event that formed the Pleiades. Using the age of $\tau$ = 50 {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-4357/628/1/L69/img1.gif] {\{}img1.gif{\}} Myr adopted by Close, the luminosity predicted by the models of Chabrier and Baraffe for AB Dor C is larger than the value reported by Close but is still within the quoted uncertainties. Meanwhile, the agreement is good when our age estimate for AB Dor C is adopted. Thus, we find no evidence in the data presented by Close for AB Dor C to suggest that previous studies using the models of Chabrier and Baraffe and bolometric luminosity as the mass indicator have significantly underestimated the masses of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {Exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval refers to the inference of atmospheric prop-erties of an exoplanet given an observed spectrum. The atmospheric properties include the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, clouds/hazes, and energy circulation. These properties, in turn, can provide key insights into the atmospheric physicochemical processes of exoplanets as well as their formation mechanisms. Major advancements in atmospheric retrieval have been made in the last decade, thanks to a combination of state-of-the-art spectroscopic obser-vations and advanced atmospheric modeling and statistical inference methods. These developments have already resulted in key constraints on the atmospheric H 2 O abundances, temperature profiles, and other properties for several exoplan-ets. Upcoming facilities such as the JWST will further advance this area. The present chapter is a pedagogical review of this exciting frontier of exoplanetary science. The principles of atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets are discussed in detail, including parametric models and statistical inference methods, along with a review of key results in the field. Some of the main challenges in retrievals with current observations are discussed along with new directions and the future landscape.},

abstract = {We report the selection and spectroscopic confirmation of 129 new late-type (K3-M6) members of the Tuc-Hor moving group, a nearby ({\~{}}40 pc), young ({\~{}}40 Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations for 13/17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67{\%}. We have used RVs, Halpha emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of {\~{}}3 in total and by a factor of {\~{}}8 for members with SpT{\textgreater}K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a 2D sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (+/-5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small, with a scatter of +/-1.1 km/s about the mean UVW velocity. We also show that the isochronal age (20--30 Myr) and the lithium depletion age (40 Myr) disagree, following a trend seen in other PMS populations. The Halpha emission follows a trend of increasing EW with later SpT, as seen for young clusters. We find that members have been depleted of lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60{\%} of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would be omitted in Xray selected samples. GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77{\%} and purity of 78{\%}. We suggest new selection criteria that yield {\textgreater}95{\%} completeness for {\~{}}40 Myr populations.(Abridged)},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a peculiar L dwarf from the United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey Large Area Survey, ULAS J222711-004547. The very red infrared photometry (MKO J - K = 2.79 ± 0.06, WISE W1-W2 = 0.65 ± 0.05) of ULAS J222711-004547 makes it one of the reddest brown dwarfs discovered so far. We obtained a moderate resolution spectrum of this target using the XSHOOTER spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, and we classify it as L7pec, confirming its very red nature. Comparison to theoretical models suggests that the object could be a low-gravity L dwarf with a solar or higher than solar metallicity. Nonetheless, the match of such fits to the spectral energy distribution is rather poor, and this and other less red peculiar L dwarfs pose new challenges for the modelling of ultracool atmospheres, especially to the understanding of the effects of condensates and their sensitivity to gravity and metallicity. We determined the proper motion of ULAS J222711-004547 using the data available in the literature, and we find that its kinematics do not suggest membership of any of the known young associations. We show that applying a simple de-reddening curve to its spectrum allows it to resemble the spectra of the L7 spectroscopic standards without any spectral features that distinguish it as a low-metallicity or low-gravity dwarf. Given the negligible interstellar reddening of the field containing our target, we conclude that the reddening of the spectrum is mostly due to an excess of dust in the photosphere of the target. De-reddening the spectrum using extinction curves for different dust species gives surprisingly good results and suggests a characteristic grain size of ˜0.5 $\mu$m. We show that by increasing the optical depth, the same extinction curves allow the spectrum of ULAS J222711-004547 to resemble the spectra of unusually blue L dwarfs and even slightly metal-poor L dwarfs. Grains of similar size also yield very good fits when de-reddening other unusually red L dwarfs in the L5-L7.5 range. These results suggest that the diversity in near-infrared colours and spectra seen in late L dwarfs could be due to differences in the optical thickness of the dust cloud deck.},

abstract = {The survey of the mid-infrared sky by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) led to the discovery of extremely cold low-mass brown dwarfs, classified as Y dwarfs, which extend the T class to lower temperatures. Twenty-four Y dwarfs are known at the time of writing. Here we present improved parallaxes for four of these, determined using Spitzer images. We give new photometry for four late-type T and three Y dwarfs, and new spectra of three Y dwarfs, obtained at Gemini Observatory. We also present previously unpublished photometry taken from HST, ESO, Spitzer and WISE archives of 11 late-type T and 9 Y dwarfs. The near-infrared data are put on to the same photometric system, forming a homogeneous data set for the coolest brown dwarfs. We compare recent models to our photometric and spectroscopic data set. We confirm that non-equilibrium atmospheric chemistry is important for these objects. Non-equilibrium cloud-free models reproduce well the near-infrared spectra and mid-infrared photometry for the warmer Y dwarfs with 425 {\textless}= T{\_}eff K {\textless}= 450. A small amount of cloud cover may improve the model fits in the near-infrared for the Y dwarfs with 325 {\textless}= T{\_}eff K {\textless}= 375. Neither cloudy nor cloud-free models reproduce the near-infrared photometry for the T{\_}eff = 250 K Y dwarf W0855. We use the mid-infrared region, where most of the flux originates, to constrain our models of W0855. We find that W0855 likely has a mass of 1.5 - 8 Jupiter masses and an age of 0.3 - 6 Gyr. The Y dwarfs with measured parallaxes are within 20 pc of the Sun and have tangential velocities typical of the thin disk. The metallicities and ages we derive for the sample are generally solar-like. We estimate that the known Y dwarfs are 3 to 20 Jupiter-mass objects with ages of 0.6 to 8.5 Gyr.},

abstract = {Direct imaging surveys for exoplanets commonly exclude binary stars from their target lists, leaving a large part of the overall planet demography unexplored. To address this gap in our understanding of planet formation and evolution, we have launched the first direct imaging survey dedicated to circumbinary planets: SPOTS, the Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical context, scientific merit, and technical feasibility of such observations, describe the target sample and observational strategy of our survey, and report on the first results from our pilot survey of 26 targets with the VLT NaCo facility. While we have not found any confirmed substellar companions to date, a number of promising candidate companions remain to be tested for common proper motion in upcoming follow-up observations. We also report on the astrometry of the three resolved binaries in our target sample. This pilot survey constitutes a successful proof of concept for our survey strategy and paves the way for a second stage of exploratory observations with VLT SPHERE.},

abstract = {The optical and infrared colors of L and T dwarfs are sensitive to cloud sedimentation and chemical equili- brium processes in their atmospheres. The i0 z0 versus J K color-color diagram provides a window into diverse atmospheric processes mainly because different chemical processes govern each color, and cloud opacity largely affects J K but not i0 z0. Using theoretical atmosphere models that include for the first time a self-consistent treatment of cloud formation, we present an interpretation of the i0 z0 versus J K color trends of known L and T dwarfs. We find that the i0 z0 color is extremely sensitive to chemical equilibrium assump- tions; chemical equilibrium models accounting for cloud sedimentation predict redder i0 z0 colors—by up to 2 mag—than models that neglect sedimentation.We explore the previously known J K color trends in which objects first become redder, then bluer with decreasing effective temperature. Only models that include sedimentation of condensates are able to reproduce these trends. We find that the exact track of a cooling brown dwarf in J K (and i0 z0) is very sensitive to the details of clouds, in particular to the efficiency of sedi- mentation of condensates in its atmosphere.Wealso find that clouds still affect the strength of the J-,H-, and K-band fluxes of even the coolest T dwarfs. In addition, we predict the locus in the i0 z0 versus J K color- color diagram of brown dwarfs cooler than yet discovered.},

abstract = {We present a fast and efficient hybrid algorithm for selecting exoplanetary candidates from wide-field transit surveys. Our method is based on the widely used SysRem and Box Least-Squares (BLS) algorithms. Patterns of systematic error that are common to all stars on the frame are mapped and eliminated using the SysRem algorithm. The remaining systematic errors caused by spatially localized flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using a boxcar-smoothing method. We show that the dimensions of the search-parameter space can be reduced greatly by carrying out an initial BLS search on a coarse grid of reduced dimensions, followed by Newton-Raphson refinement of the transit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. We illustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of the SuperWASP survey, comprising 2300 observations of 7840 stars brighter than V = 13.0. We identify 11 likely transit candidates. We reject stars that exhibit significant ellipsoidal variations caused indicative of a stellar-mass companion. We use colours and proper motions from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and USNO-B1.0 surveys to estimate the stellar parameters and the companion radius. We find that two stars showing unambiguous transit signals pass all these tests, and so qualify for detailed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.},

abstract = {Breakthrough direct detections of planetary companions orbiting A-type stars confirm the existence of massive planets at relatively large separations, but dedicated surveys are required to estimate the frequency of similar planetary systems. To measure the first estimation of the giant exoplanetary systems frequency at large orbital separation around A-stars, we have conducted a deep-imaging survey of young (8−400 Myr), nearby (19−84 pc) A- and F-stars to search for substellar companions in the ∼10−300 AU range. The sample of 42 stars combines all A-stars observed in previous AO planet search surveys reported in the literature with new AO observations from VLT/NaCo and Gemini/NIRI. It represents an initial subset of the International Deep Planet Survey (IDPS) sample of stars covering M- to B-stars. The datawere obtained with diffraction-limited observations in H-and Ks-band combined with angular differential imaging to suppress the speckle noise of the central stars, resulting in typical 5$\sigma$ detection limits in magnitude difference of 12 mag at 1, 14mag at 2 and 16mag at 5 which is sufficient to detect massive planets. Adetailed statistical analysis of the survey results is performed usingMonte Carlo simulations. Considering the planet detections, we estimate the fraction of A-stars having at least one massive planet (3−14 MJup) in the range 5−320 AU to be inside 5.9−18.8{\%} at 68{\%} confidence, assuming a flat distribution for the mass of the planets. By comparison, the brown dwarf (15−75 MJup) frequency for the sample is 2.0−8.9{\%} at 68{\%} confidence in the range 5−320 AU. Assuming power law distributions for the mass and semimajor axis of the planet population, the AO data are consistent with a declining number of massive planets with increasing orbital radius which is distinct from the rising slope inferred from radial velocity (RV) surveys around evolved A-stars and suggests that the peak of the massive planet population around A-stars may occur at separations between the ranges probed by existing RV and AO observations. Finally, we report the discovery of three new closeM-star companions to HIP 104365 and HIP 42334.},

WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 is moving at 0.44{\$} arcsec/yr and lies relatively close to the Galactic Plane (b=5.2 degrees). Near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy reveals that this is one of the reddest (2MASS J-K{\_}s = 2.55 +/- 0.08 mag) field L dwarfs yet detected, making this object an important member of the class of unusually red L dwarfs. We discuss evidence for thick condensate clouds and speculate on the age of the object. Although models by different research groups agree that thick clouds can explain the red spectrum, they predict dramatically different effective temperatures, ranging from 1100K to 1600K. This brown dwarf is well suited for additional studies of extremely dusty substellar atmospheres because it is relatively bright (K{\_}s = 13.05 +/- 0.03 mag), which should also contribute to an improved understanding of young gas-giant planets and the transition between L and T brown dwarfs.},

The relatively long periods of 2.2 to 3.4 days as well as vsini values (Joergens {\&} Guenther 2001) indicate that our targets are moderately fast rotators in contrast to very rapidly rotating old brown dwarfs. The periods for the ChaI brown dwarf candidates provide valuable data points in an as yet, in terms of rotational characteristic, almost unexplored region of the age-mass diagram. A comparison with rotational properties of older brown dwarfs indicates that most of the acceleration during the contraction phase takes place within the first 30 Myr or less of the lifetime of a brown dwarf.

Photometric variability with a peak-to-peak amplitude of {\$}4\backslashpm1{\$}{\%} at a timescale of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}6 hr was marginally detected on 2014 October 11. No high-significance variability was detected on 2013 December 22 and 2014 October 10. The amplitude and timescale of the variability seen here, as well as its evolving nature, is comparable to what was observed for a variety of field T dwarfs and suggests that mechanisms invoked to explain brown dwarf variability may be applicable to low-gravity objects such as GU Psc b. Rotation-induced photometric variability due to the formation and dissipation of atmospheric features such as clouds is a plausible hypothesis for the tentative variation detected here. Additional photometric measurements, particularly on longer timescales, will be required to confirm and characterize the variability of GU Psc b, determine its periodicity and to potentially measure its rotation period.},

Our twelve nights of photometric time-series reveal a quasi-periodic (P = 4.87+-0.01 h) variability with a maximal peak-peak amplitude of {\~{}}11{\%} and strong night-to-night evolution. We attribute this variability to the rotational modulation of fast-evolving weather patterns in the atmosphere of the coolest component ({\~{}}T1-type) of the binary, in agreement with the cloud fragmentation mechanism proposed to drive the spectroscopic morphologies of brown dwarfs at the L/T transition. No periodic signal is detected for the hottest component ({\~{}}L8-type).

abstract = {As an exoplanet orbits its host star it reflects and emits light, forming a distinctive phase curve. By observing this light, we can study the atmosphere and surface of distant planets. The planets in our Solar System show a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, with stable wind patterns, changing storms, and evolving anomalies. Brown dwarfs also exhibit atmospheric variability. Such temporal variability in the atmosphere of a giant exoplanet has not to date been observed. HAT-P-7 b is an exoplanet with a known offset in the peak of its phase curve. Here we present variations in the peak offset ranging between -0.086+0.033-0.033 to 0.143+0.040-0.037 in phase, implying that the peak brightness repeatedly shifts from one side of the planet's substellar point to the other. The variability occurs on a timescale of tens to hundreds of days. These shifts in brightness are indicative of variability in the planet's atmosphere, and result from a changing balance of thermal emission and reflected flux from the planet's dayside. We suggest that variation in wind speed in the planetary atmosphere, leading to variable cloud coverage on the dayside and a changing energy balance, is capable of explaining the observed variation.},

abstract = {The first detected interstellar object 'Oumuamua that passed within 0.25au of the Sun on 2017 September 9 was presumably ejected from a stellar system. We use its newly determined non-Keplerian trajectory together with the reconstructed Galactic orbits of 7 million stars from Gaia DR2 to identify past close encounters. Such an "encounter" could reveal the home system from which 'Oumuamua was ejected. The closest encounter, at 0.60pc (0.53-0.67pc, 90{\%} confidence interval), was with the M2.5 dwarf HIP 3757 at a relative velocity of 24.7km/s, 1Myr ago. A more distant encounter (1.6pc) but with a lower encounter (ejection) velocity of 10.7km/s was with the G5 dwarf HD 292249, 3.8Myr ago. Two more stars have encounter distances and velocities intermediate to these. The encounter parameters are similar across six different non-gravitational trajectories for 'Oumuamua. Ejection of 'Oumuamua by scattering from a giant planet in one of the systems is plausible, but requires a rather unlikely configuration to achieve the high velocities found. A binary star system is more likely to produce the observed velocities. None of the four home candidates have published exoplanets or are known to be binaries. Given that the 7 million stars in Gaia DR2 with 6D phase space information is just a small fraction of all stars for which we can eventually reconstruct orbits, it is a priori unlikely that our current search would find 'Oumuamua's home star system. As 'Oumuamua is expected to pass within 1pc of about 20 stars and brown dwarfs every Myr, the plausibility of a home system depends also on an appropriate (low) encounter velocity.},

Astrophysical parameters of extrasolar planets are directly and indirectly dependent on the properties of their respective host stars. These host stars are very frequently the only visible component in the systems. This book describes our work in the field of characterization of exoplanet host stars using interferometry to determine angular diameters, trigonometric parallax to determine physical radii, and SED fitting to determine effective temperatures and luminosities. The interferometry data are based on our decade-long survey using the CHARA Array. We describe our methods and give an update on the status of the field, including a table with the astrophysical properties of all stars with high-precision interferometric diameters out to 150 pc (status Nov 2016). In addition, we elaborate in more detail on a number of particularly significant or important exoplanet systems, particularly with respect to (1) insights gained from transiting exoplanets, (2) the determination of system habitable zones, and (3) the discrepancy between directly determined and model-based stellar radii. Finally, we discuss current and future work including the calibration of semi-empirical methods based on interferometric data.},

abstract = {The Mid-Infrared instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope will perform the first ever characterization of young giant exoplanets observed by direct imaging in the 5-28 microns spectral range. This wavelength range is key for both determining the bolometric luminosity of the cool known exoplanets and for accessing the strongest ammonia bands. In conjunction with shorter wavelength observations, MIRI will enable a more accurate characterization of the exoplanetary atmospheric properties. Here we consider a subsample of the currently known exoplanets detected by direct imaging and we discuss their detectability with MIRI, either using the coronagraphic or the spectroscopic modes. By using the Exo-REM atmosphere model we calculate the mid-infrared emission spectra of fourteen exoplanets, and we simulate MIRI coronagraphic or spectroscopic observations. Specifically we analyze four coronagraphic observational setups, which depend on (i) the target-star and reference-star offset (0, 3, 14 mas), (ii) the wave-front-error (130, 204 nm rms), (iii) the telescope jitter amplitude (1.6, 7 mas). We then determine the signal-to-noise and integration time values for the coronagraphic targets whose planet-to-star contrasts range from 3.9 to 10.1 mag. We conclude that all the MIRI targets should be observable with different degrees of difficulty, which depends on the final in-flight instrument performances. Furthermore, we test for detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of the coolest targets. Finally, we present the case of HR 8799 b to discuss what MIRI observations can bring to the knowledge of a planetary atmosphere, either alone or in combination with shorter wavelength observations.},

From a positional cross-match of SDSS, 2MASS and WISE, we have identified 144 candidate peculiar L and T dwarfs. Spectroscopy confirms that 20 of the objects are peculiar or are candidate binaries. Nine of the 420 objects in our sample are young ({\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}200 Myr; 2.1{\%}) and another 8 (1.9{\%}) are unusually red with no signatures of youth.

We have also discovered another potentially very low gravity object, the L1 dwarf 2MASS J00133470+1109403, and independently identified the young L7 dwarf 2MASS J00440332+0228112, first reported by Schneider and collaborators. Our results confirm that signatures of low gravity are no longer discernible in low to moderate resolution spectra of objects older than {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 Myr. The 1.9{\%} of unusually red L dwarfs that do not show other signatures of youth could be slightly older, up to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}400 Myr. In this case a red {\$}J-K{\_}s{\$} color may be more diagnostic of moderate youth than individual spectral features. However, its is also possible that these objects are relatively metal-rich, and so have an enhanced atmospheric dust content.},

abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional thermochemical kinetics and diffusion model for Jupiter's atmosphere that accurately describes the transition from the thermochemical regime in the deep troposphere (where chemical equilibrium is established) to the quenched regime in the upper troposphere (where chemical equilibrium is disrupted). The model is used to calculate chemical abundances of tropospheric constituents and to identify important chemical pathways for CO-CH4 interconversion in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. In particular, the observed mole fraction and chemical behavior of CO is used to indirectly constrain the jovian water inventory. Our model can reproduce the observed tropospheric CO abundance provided that the water mole fraction lies in the range (0.25-6.0)×10-3 in Jupiter's deep troposphere, corresponding to an enrichment of 0.3-7.3 times the protosolar abundance (assumed to be H2O/H2=9.61×10-4). Our results suggest that Jupiter's oxygen enrichment is roughly similar to that for carbon, nitrogen, and other heavy elements, and we conclude that formation scenarios that require very large ({\textgreater}8× solar) enrichments in water can be ruled out. We also evaluate and refine the simple time-constant arguments currently used to predict the quenched CO abundance on Jupiter, other giant planets, and brown dwarfs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We use thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model iron, magnesium, and silicon chemistry in the atmospheres of giant planets, brown dwarfs, extrasolar giant planets (EGPs), and low-mass stars. The behavior of individual Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases and condensates is determined as a function of temperature, pressure, and metallicity. Our results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere. The condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase. Monatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Mg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) cloud formation. Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in the deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs and EGPs, whereas SiH4 is dominant in the deep atmosphere of Jupiter and other gas giant planets. Several other Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases become increasingly important with decreasing effective temperature.

Extrasolar planetary objects such as brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets have no comparable sources of condensation seeds. Hence, understanding cloud formation and further its implications for the climate requires a modelling effort that includes the treatment of seed formation (nucleation), growth and evaporation, in addition to rain-out, mixing and gas-phase depletion. This paper discusses nucleation in the ultra-cool atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets whose chemical gas-phase composition differs largely from the terrestrial atmosphere. A kinetic model for atmospheric dust formation is described, which, in recent work, has become part of a cloud-formation model. For the first time, diffusive replenishment of the upper atmosphere is introduced as a source term into our model equations. This paper further aims to show how experimental and computational chemistry work links into our dust-formation model, which is driven by applications in extraterrestrial environments.},

They include direct hybrid arrays of InSb and HgCdTe photodiodes that operate from 0.6 $\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m, and of Si:As impurity band conduction detectors from 5 $\mu$m to 28 $\mu$m; a number of approaches to photoconductive detector arrays in the far-infrared; and bolometer arrays read out by transistors or superconducting devices in the far-infrared through millimeter-wave spectral range. The underlying principles behind these approaches are discussed. The application of these principles is illustrated through detailed discussion of a number of state-of-the-art detector arrays.},

abstract = {While following up L dwarf candidates selected photometrically from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, we uncovered an unusual object designated 2MASS J01415823 - 4633574. Its optical spectrum exhibits very strong bands of vanadium oxide but abnormally weak absorptions by titanium oxide, potassium, and sodium. Morphologically, such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate between old field early-L dwarfs [log (g) approximate to 5] and very late M giants [log (g) approximate to 0], leading us to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signatures of this L dwarf. Such a low gravity can be explained only if this L dwarf is much lower in mass than a typical old field L dwarf of similar temperature and is still contracting to its final radius. These conditions imply a very young age. Further evidence of youth is found in the near-infrared spectrum, including a triangular- shaped H-band continuum, reminiscent of young brown dwarf candidates discovered in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using the above information along with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models, our current best estimate is that this L dwarf has an age of 1 - 50Myr and a mass of 6 - 25M(J). Although the lack of a lithium detection ( pseudo equivalent width {\textless} 1 8) might appear to contradict other evidence of youth, we suggest that lithium becomes weaker at lower gravity like all other alkali lines and thus needs to be carefully considered before being used as a diagnostic of age or mass for objects in this regime. The location of 2MASS 0141 - 4633 on the sky coupled with a distance estimate of similar to 35 pc and the above age estimate suggests that this object may be a brown dwarf member of either the 30 Myr old Tucana/ Horologium association or the similar to 12 Myr old beta Pic moving group. Distance as determined through trigonometric parallax (underway) and a measure of the total space motion are needed to test this hypothesis.},

abstract = {The variability and rotation of ultra cool dwarfs (UCDs) provide important information on the atmospheres and evolution of these very low mass stars and brown dwarfs. As part of an ongoing program to investigate this, the projected rotation velocities, v sin i, derived from high resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy via cross correlation are presented for 16 field UCDs (M9V-L7.5V). This doubles the number of L dwarfs for which v sin i has been measured. All targets are found to have v sin i between 10 and 40 km s-1 confirming that L dwarfs are rapid rotators. Radial velocities have also been measured to a precision of 1-2 km s-1. From the random distribution of the rotation axes, i, and theoretically predicted radii, one-sided confidence intervals are placed on the rotation periods of individual objects. These are compared with published period data obtained from photometric monitoring programs. From this, the period of 31 h for the L0.5 dwarf 2M0746+2000 published by Gelino et al. ($\backslash$cite{\{}gelino02{\}}) may be ruled out as the rotation period. The period of 11.2 ± 0.8 h for the L1.5 dwarf 2M1145+2317 obtained by Bailer-Jones {\&} Mundt ($\backslash$cite{\{}bjm01{\}}) is consistent with the present v sin i results so is plausibly the true rotation period. The inclination of the rotation axis is constrained to be i=62 °-90° with an expectation value of 76°. Alternatively the data set a lower limit on the radius of 0.1 Rȯ, which is within the range of radii predicted by models for brown dwarfs older than 0.5 Gyr. Similarly, the period of 2.7 ± 0.1 h detected by the same authors for 2M1334+1940 is also confirmed as the likely rotation period; the inclination is i=27°-44° ({\textless} i {\textgreater} =34°). Where no variability or period was detected by the monitoring programs the likely reason is low contrast modulating surface features. However, in three cases variability but no period was detected, even though the likely rotation period range inferred from v sin i lies within the timescale to which the monitoring was sensitive. This reinforces the ``masking hypothesis'' of Bailer-Jones {\&} Mundt ($\backslash$cite{\{}bjm01{\}}), the idea that the evolution of photospheric features on timescales shorter than the rotation period obscure the regular modulation of the light curve. As has been previously discussed, a likely candidate for such features is inhomogeneous dust clouds.

abstract = {We present opacity sampling model atmospheres, synthetic spectra, and colors for brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the following two limiting cases of dust grain formation: (1) Inefficient gravitational settling (i.e., the dust is distributed according to the chemical equilibrium predictions) and (2) efficient gravitational settling (i.e., the dust forms and depletes refractory elements from the gas, but their opacity does not affect the thermal structure). The models include the formation of over 600 gas-phase species and 1000 liquids and crystals and the opacities of 30 different types of grains including corundum (Al2O3), the magnesium aluminum spinel MgAl2O4, iron, enstatite (MgSiO3), forsterite (Mg2SiO4), amorphous carbon, SiC, and a number of calcium silicates. The models extend from the beginning of the grain formation regime well into the condensation regime of water ice (Teff=3000-100 K) and encompass the range of logg=2.5-6.0 at solar metallicity. We find that silicate dust grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of red and brown dwarfs with a spectral type later than M8. The greenhouse effects of dust opacities provide a natural explanation for the peculiarly red spectroscopic distribution of the latest M dwarfs and young brown dwarfs. The grainless (cond) models, on the other hand, correspond closely to methane brown dwarfs such as Gliese 229B. We also discover that the $\lambda$$\lambda$5891, 5897 Na I D and $\lambda$$\lambda$7687, 7701 K I resonance doublets play a critical role in T dwarfs, in which their red wings define the pseudocontinuum from the I to the Z bandpass.},

Our index-based classification can distinguish between young and dusty objects. Guided by the resulting classifications, we propose a set of low-gravity spectral standards for the near-IR.

abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Z masses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density ($\sigma$init) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that $\sigma$init≈ 10 g cm-2near Jupiter's orbit and that $\sigma$init∝ a-2, where a is the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the "minimum-mass" solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The study of high contrast imaged brown dwarfs and exoplanets depends strongly on evolutionary models. To estimate the mass of a directly imaged substellar object, its extracted photometry or spectrum is used and adjusted with model spectra together with the estimated age of the system. These models still need to be properly tested and constrained. HD 4747B is a brown dwarf close to the H burning mass limit, orbiting a nearby, solar-type star and has been observed with the radial velocity method over almost two decades now. Its companion was also recently detected by direct imaging, allowing a complete study of this particular object. We aim to fully characterize HD 4747B by combining a well constrained dynamical mass and a study of its observed spectral features in order to test evolutionary models for substellar objects and characterize its atmosphere. We combine the radial velocity measurements of HIRES and CORALIE taken over two decades and high contrast imaging of several epochs from NACO, NIRC2 and SPHERE to obtain a dynamical mass. From the SPHERE data we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the companion from Y to H band, as well as two narrow band-width photometric measurements in the K band. A study of the primary star allows in addition to constrain the age of the system as well as its distance. Thanks to the new SPHERE epoch and NACO archival data combined with previous imaging data and high precision radial velocity measurements, we have been able to derive a well constrained orbit. We derive a dynamical mass of mB=70.0{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.6 MJup which is higher than a previous study, but in better agreement with the models. By comparing the object with known brown dwarfs spectra, we derive a spectral type of L9 and an effective temperature of 1350{\$}\backslashpm{\$}50 K.

Neural networks, also called "deep learning" or "deep nets", are a state of the art machine learning technique designed to give a computer perception into a specific problem by training it to recognize patterns. Unlike past transit detection algorithms deep nets learn to recognize planet features instead of relying on hand-coded metrics that humans perceive as the most representative. Our deep learning algorithms are capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in noisy time-series data with 99{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy compared to a 73{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy using least-squares. For planet signals smaller than the noise we devise a method for finding periodic transits using a phase folding technique that yields a constraint when fitting for the orbital period. Deep nets are highly generalizable allowing data to be evaluated from different time series after interpolation. We validate our deep net on light curves from the Kepler mission and detect periodic transits similar to the true period without any model fitting.},

abstract = {Bayesian atmospheric retrieval tools can place constraints on the properties of brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters atmospheres. To fully exploit these methods, high signal-to-noise spectral libraries with well-understood uncertainties are essential. We present a high signal-to-noise spectral library (1.10-1.69 microns) of the thermal emission of 76 brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters. All our spectra have been acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 instrument and its G141 grism. The near-infrared spectral types of these objects range from L4 to Y1. Eight of our targets have estimated masses below the deuterium-burning limit. We analyze the database to identify peculiar objects and/or multiple systems, concluding that this sample includes two very-low-surface-gravity objects and five intermediate-surface-gravity objects. In addition, spectral indices designed to search for composite atmosphere brown dwarfs, indicate that eight objects in our sample are strong candidates to have such atmospheres. None of these objects are overluminous, thus their composite atmospheres are unlikely a companion-induced artifact. Five of the eight confirmed candidates have been reported as photometrically variable, suggesting that composite atmospheric indices are useful in identifying brown dwarfs with strongly heterogeneous cloud covers. We compare hot Jupiters and brown dwarfs in a near-infrared color-magnitude diagram. We confirm that the coldest hot Jupiters in our sample have spectra similar to mid-L dwarfs, and the hottest hot Jupiters have spectra similar to those of M-dwarfs. Our sample provides a uniform dataset of a broad range of ultracool atmospheres, allowing large-scale, comparative studies, and providing a HST legacy spectral library.},

abstract = {We use Kepler K2 Campaign 4 short-cadence photometry to measure white light flares in the young, moving group brown dwarfs 2MASS J03350208+2342356 (2M0335+23) and 2MASS J03552337+1133437 (2M0355+11), and report on long-cadence photometry of a flare in the Pleiades M8 brown dwarf CFHT-PL-17. We also report a new measurement of the radial velocity of 2M0335+23 which confirms that this M7 brown dwarf is a beta Pic Moving Group member. We identify a long-lived starspot, and find that the rotation period (5.24 hr) and projected rotational velocity (45 km/s) confirm 2M0335+23 is inflated ({\$}R \backslashge 0.20 R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) as predicted. We detect 22 white light flares on 2M0335+23. The flare frequency distribution follows a power-law distribution with slope {\$}-\backslashalpha = -1.7{\$} over the range {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}31{\}}{\$} to {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}33{\}}{\$} erg. This slope is similar to that observed in the Sun and warmer flare stars, and with lower energy flares in previous ground-based work on M6-M8 field very-low-mass stars; taken the two datasets together, the flare frequency distribution for young brown dwarfs is a power law over 4.3 orders of magnitude. Even more energetic flares are possible on warm brown dwarfs, as demonstrated by the superflare on the 130-Myr old CFHT-PL-17, which we estimate had an energy of {\$}2.6\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}34{\}}{\$} erg. In contrast, we detect no white light flares down to an energy limit of {\$}2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}30{\}}{\$} erg in the nearby L{\$}5\backslashgamma{\$} brown dwarf 2M0355+11, a member of the 150-Myr old AB Dor Moving Group. This is consistent with the view that fast magnetic reconnection is suppressed in cool atmospheres. We discuss two complex, multi-peaked flares observed in 2M0335+23 and compare them to complex flares observed on warmer stars. We argue that these complex flares can be understood as sympathetic flares, in which fast-mode MHD waves similar to EUV waves in the Sun trigger magnetic reconnection in different active regions.},

abstract = {We present results from a two-night R{\~{}}4000 0.9-2.5 micron spectroscopic monitoring campaign of Luhman 16AB (L7.5 + T0.5). We assess the variability amplitude as a function of pressure level in the atmosphere of Luhman 16B: the more variable of the two components. The amplitude decreases monotonically with decreasing pressure, indicating that the source of variability - most likely patchy clouds - lies in the lower atmosphere. An unexpected result is that the strength of the K I absorption is higher in the faint state of Luhman 16B and lower in the bright state. We conclude that either the abundance of K I increases when the clouds roll in, potentially because of additional K I in the cloud itself, or that the temperature-pressure profile changes. We reproduce the change in K I absorption strengths with combinations of spectral templates to represent the bright and the faint variability states. These are dominated by a warmer L8 or L9 component, with a smaller contribution from a cooler T1 or T2 component. The success of this approach argues that the mechanism responsible for brown dwarf variability is also behind the diverse spectral morphology across the L-to-T transition. We further suggest that the L9-T1 part of the sequence represents a narrow but random ordering of effective temperatures and cloud fractions, obscured by the monotonic progression in methane absorption strength.},

abstract = {We developed a simple, physical and self-consistent cloud model for brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. We compared different parametrisations for the cloud particle size, by either fixing particle radii, or fixing the mixing efficiency (parameter fsed) or estimating particle radii from simple microphysics. The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears as the best parametrisation by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra of brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the L-T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the visible/near-IR photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for low-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity. In addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical equilibriums, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature. This effect should significantly contribute to the strong variation of methane abundance at the L-T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young exoplanets. Finally, we predict the existence of a continuum of brown dwarfs and exoplanets for absolute J magnitude=15-18 and J-K color=0-3, due to the evolution of the L-T transition with gravity. This self-consistent model therefore provides a general framework to understand the effects of clouds and appears well-suited for atmospheric retrievals.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an unusually red brown dwarf found in a search for high proper motion objects using WISE and 2MASS data. WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 is moving at 0farcs44 yr-1 and lies relatively close to the Galactic plane (b = 5fdg2). Near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy reveals that this is one of the reddest (2MASS J - Ks = 2.55 ± 0.08 mag) field L dwarfs yet detected, making this object an important member of the class of unusually red L dwarfs. We discuss evidence for thick condensate clouds and speculate on the age of the object. Although models by different research groups agree that thick clouds can explain the red spectrum, they predict dramatically different effective temperatures, ranging from 1100 K to 1600 K. This brown dwarf is well suited for additional studies of extremely dusty substellar atmospheres because it is relatively bright (Ks = 13.05 ± 0.03 mag), which should also contribute to an improved understanding of young gas-giant planets and the transition between L and T brown dwarfs.},

With combined nightly data-rates of typically 1TB, automated pipeline processing and data management requirements are paramount. Pipeline processing of IR data is far more technically challenging than for optical data. IR detectors are inherently more unstable, while the sky emission is over 100 times brighter than most objects of interest, and varies in a complex spatial and temporal manner. In this presentation we describe the pipeline architecture being developed to deal with the IR imaging data from WFCAM and VISTA, and discuss the primary issues involved in an end-to-end system capable of: robustly removing instrument and night sky signatures; monitoring data quality and system integrity; providing astrometric and photometric calibration; and generating photon noise-limited images and astronomical catalogues. Accompanying papers by Emerson etal and Hambly etal provide an overview of the project and a detailed description of the science archive aspects.},

@article{Cowan2009,
abstract = {When Earth-mass extrasolar planets first become detectable, one challenge will be to determine which of these worlds harbor liquid water, a widely used criterion for habitability. Some of the first observations of these planets will consist of disc-averaged, time-resolved broadband photometry. To simulate such data, the Deep Impact spacecraft obtained light curves of Earth at seven wavebands spanning 300-1000 nm as part of the EPOXI mission of opportunity. In this paper, we analyze disc-integrated light curves, treating Earth as if it were an exoplanet, to determine if we can detect the presence of oceans and continents. We present two observations each spanning 1 day, taken at gibbous phases of 57° and 77°, respectively. As expected, the time-averaged spectrum of Earth is blue at short wavelengths due to Rayleigh scattering, and gray redward of 600 nm due to reflective clouds. The rotation of the planet leads to diurnal albedo variations of 15{\%}-30{\%}, with the largest relative changes occurring at the reddest wavelengths. To characterize these variations in an unbiased manner, we carry out a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this analysis reveals that 98{\%} of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only two dominant eigencolors. We use the time variations of these two eigencolors to construct longitudinal maps of the Earth, treating it as a non-uniform Lambert sphere. We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors correspond to cloud-free continents and oceans despite the fact that our observations were taken on days with typical cloud cover. We also find that the near-infrared wavebands are particularly useful in distinguishing between land and water. Based on this experiment, we conclude that it should be possible to infer the existence of water oceans on exoplanets with time-resolved broadband observations taken by a large space-based coronagraphic telescope.},

We investigate the noise properties of our data, finding correlated `red' noise at the 1 - 1.5 mmag level in bright stars, over transit-like timescales of 2.5 hours. An important source of correlated noise in aperture photometry is image blending, which produces variations correlated with the seeing. We present a simple blend index based on fitting polynomials to these variations, and find that subtracting the fit from the data provides a method to reduce their amplitude, in lieu of using techniques such as point spread function fitting photometry which tackle their cause. Finally, we use the Sysrem algorithm to search for any further systematic effects.},

In parallel, substantial theoretical developments have been carried out in the last few years, including the physics of the star-disk interaction, numerical simulations of stellar winds, and the investigation of angular momentum transport processes in stellar interiors. This chapter reviews both the recent observational and theoretical advances that prompted the development of renewed angular momentum evolution models for cool stars and brown dwarfs.

abstract = {Condensation clouds in substellar atmospheres have been widely inferred from spectra and photometric variability. Up until now, their horizontally averaged vertical distribution and mean particle size have been largely characterized using models, one of which is the eddy diffusion-sedimentation model from Ackerman {\&} Marley (2001) that relies on a sedimentation efficiency parameter, {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$}, to determine the vertical extent of clouds in the atmosphere. However, the physical processes controlling the vertical structure of clouds in substellar atmospheres are not well understood. In this work, we derive trends in {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$} across a large range of eddy diffusivities ({\$}K{\_}{\{}zz{\}}{\$}), gravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud distributions calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find that {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$} is dependent on {\$}K{\_}{\{}zz{\}}{\$}, but not gravity, when {\$}K{\_}{\{}zz{\}}{\$} is held constant. {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$} is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud particles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and molecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud particles, leading to large {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$} ({\$}{\textgreater}{\$}1), and vice versa for materials with low surface energy. For cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation, {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$} is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius, connecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects' formation environments and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to improved cloud models that help us better understand substellar atmospheres. For example, we demonstrate that {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sed{\}}{\$} could increase with increasing cloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown dwarf L/T transition.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of another seven Y dwarfs from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Using these objects, as well as the first six WISE Y dwarf discoveries from Cushing et al., we further explore the transition between spectral types T and Y. We find that the T/Y boundary roughly coincides with the spot where the J - H colors of brown dwarfs, as predicted by models, turn back to the red. Moreover, we use preliminary trigonometric parallax measurements to show that the T/Y boundary may also correspond to the point at which the absolute H (1.6 mum) and W2 (4.6 mum) magnitudes plummet. We use these discoveries and their preliminary distances to place them in the larger context of the solar neighborhood. We present a table that updates the entire stellar and substellar constituency within 8 pc of the Sun, and we show that the current census has hydrogen-burning stars outnumbering brown dwarfs by roughly a factor of six. This factor will decrease with time as more brown dwarfs are identified within this volume, but unless there is a vast reservoir of cold brown dwarfs invisible to WISE, the final space density of brown dwarfs is still expected to fall well below that of stars. We also use these new Y dwarf discoveries, along with newly discovered T dwarfs from WISE, to investigate the field substellar mass function. We find that the overall space density of late-T and early-Y dwarfs matches that from simulations describing the mass function as a power law with slope -0.5 {\textless} alpha {\textless} 0.0; however, a power law may provide a poor fit to the observed object counts as a function of spectral type because there are tantalizing hints that the number of brown dwarfs continues to rise from late-T to early-Y. More detailed monitoring and characterization of these Y dwarfs, along with dedicated searches aimed at identifying more examples, are certainly required.},

abstract = {In the present study we aim to investigate the circumstellar environment of the spectroscopic binary T Tauri star CS Cha. From unresolved mid- to far-infrared photometry it is predicted that CS Cha hosts a disk with a large cavity. In addition, SED modeling suggests significant dust settling, pointing towards an evolved disk that may show signs of ongoing or completed planet formation. We observed CS Cha with the high contrast imager VLT/SPHERE in polarimetric differential imaging mode to resolve the circumbinary disk in near infrared scattered light. These observations were followed-up by VLT/NACO L-band observations and complemented by archival VLT/NACO K-band and HST/WFPC2 I-band data. We resolve the compact circumbinary disk around CS Cha for the first time in scattered light. We find a smooth, low inclination disk with an outer radius of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}55 au (at 165 pc). We do not detect the inner cavity but find an upper limit for the cavity size of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}15 au. Furthermore, we find a faint co-moving companion with a projected separation of 210 au from the central binary outside of the circumbinary disk. The companion is detected in polarized light and shows an extreme degree of polarization (13.7{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.4 $\backslash${\%} in J-band). The companion's J- and H-band magnitudes are compatible with masses of a few M{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}. However, K-, L- and I-band data draw this conclusion into question. We explore with radiative transfer modeling whether an unresolved circum-companion disk can be responsible for the high polarization and complex photometry. We find that the set of observations is best explained by a heavily extincted low mass ({\$}\backslashsim 20 \backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}) brown dwarf or high mass planet with an unresolved disk and dust envelope.},

abstract = {Planetary science beyond the boundaries of our Solar System is today in its infancy. Until a couple of decades ago, the detailed investigation of the planetary properties was restricted to objects orbiting inside the Kuiper Belt. Today, we cannot ignore that the number of known planets has increased by two orders of magnitude nor that these planets resemble anything but the objects present in our own Solar System. Whether this fact is the result of a selection bias induced by the kind of techniques used to discover new planets -mainly radial velocity and transit - or simply the proof that the Solar System is a rarity in the Milky Way, we do not know yet. What is clear, though, is that the Solar System has failed to be the paradigm not only in our Galaxy but even 'just' in the solar neighbourhood. This finding, although unsettling, forces us to reconsider our knowledge of planets under a different light and perhaps question a few of the theoretical pillars on which we base our current 'understanding'. The next decade will be critical to advance in what we should perhaps call Galactic planetary science. In this paper, we review highlights and pitfalls of our current knowledge of this topic and elaborate on how this knowledge might arguably evolve in the next decade.More critically, we identify what should be the mandatory scientific and technical steps to be taken in this fascinating journey of remote exploration of planets in our Galaxy.},

For four brown dwarfs, we also obtained simulataneous {\$}HST{\$}/WFC3 G141 Grism spectra during two epochs and derived light curves in five narrow-band filters. Probing different pressure levels in the atmospheres, the multi-wavelength light curves of our six targets all exhibit variations, and the shape of the light curves evolves over the timescale of a rotation period, ranging from 1.4 h to 13 h. We compare the shapes of the light curves and estimate the phase shifts between the light curves observed at different wavelengths by comparing the phase of the primary Fourier components. We use state-of-the-art atmosphere models to determine the flux contribution of different pressure layers to the observed flux in each filter. We find that the light curves that probe higher pressures are similar and in phase, but are offset and often different from the light curves that probe lower pressures. The phase differences between the two groups of light curves suggest that the modulations seen at lower and higher pressures may be introduced by different cloud layers.},

abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is a powerful technique that can reveal Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, can enable detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres, and is a key step toward imaging Earth-like planets. Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system.},

The light curves show a periodic modulation with a period of {\~{}}2.4 hours, a peak-to-peak amplitude of {\~{}}50 mmag and significant night-to-night evolution. We suggest that the light curve modulation is due to the brown dwarf's rotation and that the longer term variations come from surface features evolution and/or differential rotation. We obtained complementary observations over a single night in the J and Ks bands; the object displays correlated photometric variability in both bands, albeit with smaller Ks-band amplitude. The ratio of the Ks and J variability amplitudes puts strong constraints on the physical mechanisms at play.

Through a deep integration with the Short-Wavelength-Spectrometer (SWS) on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), the pure rotational v=0-0 R(5) line at 19.43 mu m was detected toward the Orion (OMC-1) outflow at its brightest H{\_}2$\backslash$ emission region, Peak 1. The {\~{}} 20'' beam-averaged observed flux of the line is (1.84 +/- 0.4) x 10(-5) erg cm(-2) s(-1) sr(-1) . Upper flux limits were derived for sixteen other rotational and ro-vibrational HD lines in the wavelength range 2.5 to 38 mu m. We utilize the rich spectrum of H{\_}2$\backslash$ lines observed at the same position to correct for extinction, and to derive a total warm HD column density under the assumption that similar excitation conditions apply to H{\_}2$\backslash$ and HD. Because the observed HD level population is not thermalized at the densities prevailing in the emitting region, the total HD column density is sensitive to the assumed gas density, temperature, and dissociation fraction. Accounting for non-LTE HD level populations in a partially dissociated gas, our best estimate for the total warm HD column density is N(HD)=(2.0+/- 0.75)x 10(16) cm(-2) . The warm molecular hydrogen column density is (2.21+/-0.24)x 10(21) cm(-2) , so that the relative abundance is [HD]/[H{\_}2]=(9.0+/- 3.5)x 10(-6) . The observed emission presumably arises in the warm layers of partially dissociative magnetic shocks, where HD can be depleted relative to H{\_}2 due to an asymmetry in the deuterium-hydrogen exchange reaction. This leads to an average HD depletion relative to H{\_}2$\backslash$ of about 40{\%}. Correcting for this chemical depletion, we derive a deuterium abundance in the warm shocked gas, [D]/[H]= (7.6+/- 2.9) x 10(-6) . The derived deuterium abundance is not very sensitive to the dissociation fraction in the emitting region, since both the non-LTE and the chemical depletion corrections act in oppositite direction. Our implied deuterium abundance is low compared to previous determinations in the local interstellar medium, but it is consistent with two other recent observations toward Orion, suggesting that deuterium may be significantly depleted there.

Observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect is now a near routine procedure. It is an important element in the orbital characterisation of transiting exoplanets. Measurements of the spin-orbit angle have revealed a surprising diversity, far from the placid, Kantian and Laplacian ideals, whereby planets form, and remain, on orbital planes coincident with their star's equator. This chapter will review a short history of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, how it is modelled, and will summarise the current state of the field before describing other uses for a spectroscopic transit, and alternative methods of measuring the spin-orbit angle.},

abstract = {As the only directly imaged multiple planet system, HR 8799 provides a unique opportunity to study the physical properties of several planets in parallel. In this paper, we image all four of the HR 8799 planets at H band and 3.3 $\mu$m with the new Large Binocular Telescope adaptive optics system, PISCES, and LBTI/LMIRCam. Our images offer an unprecedented view of the system, allowing us to obtain H and 3.3 $\mu$m photometry of the innermost planet (for the first time) and put strong upper limits on the presence of a hypothetical fifth companion. We find that all four planets are unexpectedly bright at 3.3 $\mu$m compared to the equilibrium chemistry models used for field brown dwarfs, which predict that planets should be faint at 3.3 $\mu$m due to CH4 opacity. We attempt to model the planets with thick-cloudy, non-equilibrium chemistry atmospheres but find that removing CH4 to fit the 3.3 $\mu$m photometry increases the predicted L' (3.8 $\mu$m) flux enough that it is inconsistent with observations. In an effort to fit the spectral energy distribution of the HR 8799 planets, we construct mixtures of cloudy atmospheres, which are intended to represent planets covered by clouds of varying opacity. In this scenario, regions with low opacity look hot and bright, while regions with high opacity look faint, similar to the patchy cloud structures on Jupiter and L/T transition brown dwarfs. Our mixed-cloud models reproduce all of the available data, but self-consistent models are still necessary to demonstrate their viability.

abstract = {Aurorae are detected from all the magnetized planets in our Solar System, including Earth. They are powered by magnetospheric current systems that lead to the precipitation of energetic electrons into the high-latitude regions of the upper atmosphere. In the case of the gas-giant planets, these aurorae include highly polarized radio emission at kilohertz and megahertz frequencies produced by the precipitating electrons, as well as continuum and line emission in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the spectrum, associated with the collisional excitation and heating of the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Here we report simultaneous radio and optical spectroscopic observations of an object at the end of the stellar main sequence, located right at the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs, from which we have detected radio and optical auroral emissions both powered by magnetospheric currents. Whereas the magnetic activity of stars like our Sun is powered by processes that occur in their lower atmospheres, these aurorae are powered by processes originating much further out in the magnetosphere of the dwarf star that couple energy into the lower atmosphere. The dissipated power is at least four orders of magnitude larger than what is produced in the Jovian magnetosphere, revealing aurorae to be a potentially ubiquitous signature of large-scale magnetospheres that can scale to luminosities far greater than those observed in our Solar System. These magnetospheric current systems may also play a part in powering some of the weather phenomena reported on brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {Photometric variability detection is often considered as a hypothesis testing problem: an object is variable if the null-hypothesis that its brightness is constant can be ruled out given the measurements and their uncertainties. Uncorrected systematic errors limit the practical applicability of this approach to high-amplitude variability and well-behaving data sets. Searching for a new variability detection technique that would be applicable to a wide range of variability types while being robust to outliers and underestimated measurement uncertainties, we propose to consider variability detection as a classification problem that can be approached with machine learning. We compare several classification algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Neural Nets (NN), Random Forests (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting classifier (SGB) applied to 18 features (variability indices) quantifying scatter and/or correlation between points in a light curve. We use a subset of OGLE-II Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) photometry (30265 light curves) that was searched for variability using traditional methods (168 known variable objects identified) as the training set and then apply the NN to a new test set of 31798 OGLE-II LMC light curves. Among 205 candidates selected in the test set, 178 are real variables, 13 low-amplitude variables are new discoveries. We find that the considered machine learning classifiers are more efficient (they find more variables and less false candidates) compared to traditional techniques that consider individual variability indices or their linear combination. The NN, SGB, SVM and RF show a higher efficiency compared to LR and kNN.},

abstract = {The AB Dor Moving Group consists of a "nucleus" of {\~{}}10 stars at d {\~{}} 20 pc, along with dozens of purported "stream" members distributed across the sky. We perform a chemical and kinematic analysis of a subsample of AB Dor stream stars to test whether they constitute a physical stellar group. We use the NEMO Galactic kinematic code to investigate the orbits of the stream members, and perform a chemical abundance analysis using high resolution spectra taken with the Magellan Clay 6.5-m telescope. Using a chi{\^{}}2 test with the measured abundances for 10 different elements, we find that only half of the purported AB Dor stream members could possibly constitute a statistically chemically homogeneous sample. Some stream members with 3D velocities were hundreds of parsecs from the AB Dor nucleus {\~{}}10{\^{}}8 yr ago, and hence were unlikely to share a common origin. We conclude that the published lists of AB Dor moving group stream members are unlikely to represent the dispersed remnant of a single star formation episode. A subsample of the stream stars appears to be both statistically chemically homogeneous and in the vicinity of the AB Dor nucleus at birth. Their mean metallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.02 +/- 0.02 dex, which we consider representative for the AB Dor group. Finally, we report a strong lower limit on the age of the AB Dor nucleus of {\textgreater}110 Myr based on the pre-MS contraction times for K-type members which have reached the main sequence.},

abstract = {Clouds and hazes are commonplace in the atmospheres of solar system planets and are likely ubiquitous in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets as well. Clouds affect every aspect of a planetary atmosphere, from the transport of radiation, to atmospheric chemistry, to dynamics and they influence - if not control - aspects such as surface temperature and habitability. In this review we aim to provide an introduction to the role and properties of clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres. We consider the role clouds play in influencing the spectra of planets as well as their habitability and detectability. We briefly summarize how clouds are treated in terrestrial climate models and consider the far simpler approaches that have been taken so far to model exoplanet clouds, the evidence for which we also review. Since clouds play a major role in the atmospheres of certain classes of brown dwarfs we briefly discuss brown dwarf cloud modeling as well. We also review how the scattering and extinction efficiencies of cloud particles may be approximated in certain limiting cases of small and large particles in order to facilitate physical understanding. Since clouds play such important roles in planetary atmospheres, cloud modeling may well prove to be the limiting factor in our ability to interpret future observations of extrasolar planets.},

The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X=0.7491), helium (Y=0.2377), and heavy elements (Z=0.0133), leading to Z/X=0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X=0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0=0.7110, Y0=0.2741, and Z0=0.0149.

abstract = {We report new L and T dwarfs found in a cross-match of the SDSS Data Release 1 and 2MASS. Our simultaneous search of the two databases effectively allows us to relax the criteria for object detection in either survey and to explore the combined databases to a greater completeness level. We find two new T dwarfs in addition to the 13 already known in the SDSS DR1 footprint. We also identify 22 new candidate and bona fide L dwarfs, including a new young L2 dwarf and a peculiar potentially metal-poor L2 dwarf with unusually blue near-IR colors. These discoveries underscore the utility of simultaneous database cross-correlation in searching for rare objects. Our cross-match completes the census of T dwarfs within the joint SDSS and 2MASS flux limits to the 97{\%} level. Hence, we are able to accurately infer the space density of T dwarfs. We employ Monte Carlo tools to simulate the observed population of SDSS DR1 T dwarfs with 2MASS counterparts and find that the space density of T0-T8 dwarf systems is  --{\textgreater}0.0070−0.0030+0.0032 pc−3 (95{\%} confidence interval), i.e., about one per 140 pc3.

We measure parallaxes for 83 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6-T9) in 49 systems, with a median uncertainty of 1.1 mas (2.3{\%}) and as good as 0.7 mas (0.8{\%}). We provide the first parallaxes for 48 objects in 29 systems, and for another 27 objects in 17 systems, we significantly improve upon published results, with a median (best) improvement of 1.7 times (5 times). Three systems show astrometric perturbations indicative of orbital motion; two are known binaries (2MASS J0518-2828AB and 2MASS J1404-3159AB) and one is spectrally peculiar (SDSS J0805+4812). In addition, we present here a large set of Keck adaptive optics imaging that more than triples the number of binaries with L6-T5 components that have both multi-band photometry and distances. Our data enable an unprecedented look at the photometric properties of brown dwarfs as they cool through the L/T transition. Going from {\{}$\backslash$ap{\}}L8 to {\{}$\backslash$ap{\}}T4.5, flux in the Y and J bands increases by {\{}$\backslash$ap{\}}0.7 mag and {\{}$\backslash$ap{\}}0.5 mag, respectively (the Y- and J-band ''bumps''), while flux in the H, K, and L' bands declines monotonically. This wavelength dependence is consistent with cloud clearing over a narrow range of temperature, since condensate opacity is expected to dominate at 1.0-1.3 {\{}$\mu${\}}m. Interestingly, despite more than doubling the near-IR census of L/T transition objects, we find a conspicuous paucity of objects on the color-magnitude diagram just blueward of the late-L/early-T sequence. This ''L/T gap'' occurs at (J - H){\_}{\{}MKO{\}} = 0.1-0.3 mag, (J - K){\_}{\{}MKO{\}} = 0.0-0.4 mag, and implies that the last phases of cloud evolution occur rapidly. Finally, we provide a comprehensive update to the absolute magnitudes of ultracool dwarfs as a function of spectral type using a combined sample of 314 objects.},

abstract = {High-contrast near-infrared imaging of the nearby star HR 8799 has shown three giant planets. Such images were possible due to the wide orbits ({\textgreater} 25 AU) and youth ({\textless} 100 Myr) of the imaged planets, which are still hot and bright as they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation. A major area of contention in the extrasolar planet community is whether outer planets ({\textgreater} 10 AU) more massive than Jupiter form via one-step gravitational instabilities or, rather, via a two-step process involving accretion of a core followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Here we report the presence of a fourth planet, interior to and about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. With its four young giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts, the HR 8799 planetary system is a unique laboratory to study the formation and evolution of giant planets at wide {\textgreater} 10 AU separations.},

abstract = {We present the results of a photometric monitoring campaign for very low mass (VLM) members of the Pleiades. Periodic photometric variability was detected for nine VLM stars with masses between 0.08 and 0.25 MS. These variations are most likely caused by co-rotating, magnetically induced spots. In comparison with solar-mass stars, the photometric amplitudes are very low ({\textless}0.04 mag), implying that either the fraction of the spot-covered area, the asymmetry of the spot distribution, or the contrast between spots and photospheric environment decreases with mass. From our lightcurves, there is evidence for temporal evolution of the spot patterns on timescales of about two weeks. The rotation periods range from 2.9 h to 40 h and tend to increase linearly with mass. Compared with more massive stars, we clearly see a lack of slow rotators among VLM objects. The rotational evolution of VLM stars is investigated by evolving the previously published periods for very young objects (Scholz {\&} Eisloeffel 2004) forward in time, and comparing them with those observed here in the Pleiades. We find that the combination of spin-up by pre-main sequence contraction and exponential angular momentum loss through stellar winds is able to reproduce the observed period distribution in the Pleiades. This result may be explained as a consequence of convective, small-scale magnetic fields.},

LACEwING is a convergence-style algorithm with carefully vetted membership statistics based on a large numerical simulation of the Solar Neighborhood. Given spatial and kinematic information on stars, LACEwING calculates membership probabilities in 13 NYMGs and three open clusters within 100 pc. In addition to describing the inputs, methods, and products of the code, we provide comparisons of LACEwING to other popular kinematic moving group membership identification codes. As a proof of concept, we use LACEwING to reconsider the membership of 930 stellar systems in the Solar Neighborhood (within 100 pc) that have reported measurable lithium equivalent widths. We quantify the evidence in support of a population of young stars not attached to any NYMGs, which is a possible sign of new as-yet-undiscovered groups or of a field population of young stars.},

abstract = {Like the magnetised planets in our Solar System, magnetised exoplanets should emit strongly at radio wavelengths. Radio emission directly traces the planetary magnetic fields and radio detections can place constraints on the physical parameters of these features. Large comparative studies of predicted radio emission characteristics for the known population of exoplanets help to identify what physical parameters could be key for producing bright, observable radio emission. Since the last comparative study, many thousands of exoplanets have been discovered. We report new estimates for the radio flux densities and maximum emission frequencies for the current population of known exoplanets orbiting pre-main sequence and main-sequence stars with spectral types F-M. The set of exoplanets predicted to produce observable radio emission are Hot Jupiters orbiting young stars. The youth of these system predicts strong stellar magnetic fields and/or dense winds, which are key for producing bright, observable radio emission. We use a new all-sky circular polarisation Murchison Widefield Array survey to place sensitive limits on 200 MHz emission from exoplanets, with {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} values ranging from 4.0 - 45.0 mJy. Using a targeted Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope observing campaign, we also report a {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} upper limit of 4.5 mJy on the radio emission from V830 Tau b, the first Hot Jupiter to be discovered orbiting a pre-main sequence star. Our limit is the first to be reported for the low-frequency radio emission from this source.},

abstract = {Observations have shown that continuous radio emission and also sporadic H$\alpha$ and X-ray emission are prominent in singular, low-mass objects later than spectral class M. These activity signatures are interpreted as being caused by coupling of an ionized atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What remains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can produce the necessary level of ionization. At these low temperatures, thermal gas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud particles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionize the ambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field coupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks. However, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged. We use results from DRIFT-PHOENIX model atmospheres to investigate collisional processes that can lead to the ionization of dust grains inside clouds. We show that ionization by turbulence-induced dust-dust collisions is the most efficient kinetic process. The efficiency is highest in the inner cloud where particles grow quickly and, hence, the dust-to-gas ratio is high. Dust-dust collisions alone are not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside the cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas phase as separated electrons can trigger secondary nonlinear processes. Cosmic rays are likely to increase the global level of ionization, but their influence decreases if a strong, large-scale magnetic field is present as on brown dwarfs. We suggest that although thermal gas ionization declines in objects across the fully convective boundary, dust charging by collisional processes can play an important role in the lowest mass objects. The onset of atmospheric dust may therefore correlate with the anomalous X-ray and radio emission in atmospheres that are cool, but charged more than expected by pure thermal ionization. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {In an atmosphere, a cloud condensation region is characterized by a strong vertical gradient in the abundance of the related condensing species. On Earth, the ensuing gradient of mean molecular weight has relatively few dynamical consequences because N{\$}{\_}2{\$} is heavier than water vapor, so that only the release of latent heat significantly impacts convection. On the contrary, in an hydrogen dominated atmosphere (e.g. giant planets), all condensing species are significantly heavier than the background gas. This can stabilize the atmosphere against convection near a cloud deck if the enrichment in the given species exceeds a critical threshold. This raises two questions. What is transporting energy in such a stabilized layer, and how affected can the thermal profile of giant planets be? To answer these questions, we first carry out a linear analysis of the convective and double-diffusive instabilities in a condensable medium showing that an efficient condensation can suppress double-diffusive convection. This suggests that a stable radiative layer can form near a cloud condensation level, leading to an increase in the temperature of the deep adiabat. Then, we investigate the impact of the condensation of the most abundant species---water---with a steady-state atmosphere model. Compared to standard models, the temperature increase can reach several hundred degrees at the quenching depth of key chemical tracers. Overall, this effect could have many implications for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical state of the atmosphere of giant planets, for their future observations (with Juno for example), and for their internal evolution.},

A theory for small dissipation rates is developed to examine the role of wave-wave interaction in the dynamics of vacillation and aperiodicity in unstable systems.It is shown that the form of the dissipation mechanism as well as the overall dissipation timescale determines the nature of the dynamics. In particular, dissipation proportional to potential vorticity is shown to expunge amplitude vacillation due to wave-mean flow interactions.Wave-wave interaction, however, can yield amplitude vacillation. As the dissipation is decreased, the solutions evolve from steady waves (although propagating) to periodic vacillation until finally at small dissipation rates, chaotic behavior is obtained.This occurs in a range of relative growth rates of the two waves which depends on the strength of the wave-wave and wave-mean flow interactions.},

With associated periods of 1-4 hours, this potentially new class of pulsation offers unprecedented opportunities to probe the interiors and evolution of low-mass objects in the 1-15 million year age range. Following up on reports of short-period variability in young clusters, we designed a high-cadence photometric monitoring campaign to search for deuterium-burning pulsation among a sample of 348 BDs and VLMSs in the four young clusters {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} Orionis, Chamaeleon I, IC 348, and Upper Scorpius. In the resulting light curves we achieved sensitivity to periodic signals of amplitude several millimagnitudes, on timescales from 15 minutes to two weeks. Despite the exquisite data quality, we failed to detect any periodicities below seven hours. We conclude that D-burning pulsations are not able to grow to observable amplitudes in the early pre-main sequence. In spite of the non-detection, we did uncover a rich set of variability behavior- both periodic and aperiodic- on day to week timescales. We present new compilations of variable sources from our sample, as well as three new candidate cluster members in Chamaeleon I.},

Future bio-signature discoveries will probably deeply impact our scientific and philosophical understanding of life formation and evolution. In that unique perspective, the role of observation is crucial to extend our understanding of the formation and physics of giant planets shaping planetary systems. With the development of high contrast imaging techniques and instruments over more than two decades, vast efforts have been devoted to detect and characterize lighter, cooler and closer companions to nearby stars, and ultimately image new planetary systems. Complementary to other planet-hunting techniques, this approach has opened a new astrophysical window to study the physical properties and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs and planets. I will briefly review the different observing techniques and strategies used, the main samples of targeted stars, the key discoveries and surveys, to finally address the main results obtained so far about the physics and the mechanisms of formation and evolution of young giant planets and planetary system architectures.},

abstract = {With an orbital distance comparable to that of Saturn in the solar system, $\backslash$bpic b is the closest (semi-major axis {\$}\backslashsimeq{\$}$\backslash$,9$\backslash$,au) exoplanet that has been imaged to orbit a star. Thus it offers unique opportunities for detailed studies of its orbital, physical, and atmospheric properties, and of disk-planet interactions. With the exception of the discovery observations in 2003 with NaCo at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), all following astrometric measurements relative to $\backslash$bpic have been obtained in the southwestern part of the orbit, which severely limits the determination of the planet's orbital parameters. We aimed at further constraining $\backslash$bpic b orbital properties using more data, and, in particular, data taken in the northeastern part of the orbit. We used SPHERE at the VLT to precisely monitor the orbital motion of beta $\backslash$bpic b since first light of the instrument in 2014. We were able to monitor the planet until November 2016, when its angular separation became too small (125 mas, i.e., 1.6$\backslash$,au) and prevented further detection. We redetected $\backslash$bpic b on the northeast side of the disk at a separation of 139$\backslash$,mas and a PA of 30{\$}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} in September 2018. The planetary orbit is now well constrained. With a semi-major axis (sma) of {\$}a = 9.0 \backslashpm 0.5{\$} au (1 {\$}\backslashsigma {\$}), it definitely excludes previously reported possible long orbital periods, and excludes $\backslash$bpic b as the origin of photometric variations that took place in 1981. We also refine the eccentricity and inclination of the planet. From an instrumental point of view, these data demonstrate that it is possible to detect, if they exist, young massive Jupiters that orbit at less than 2 au from a star that is 20 pc away.},

abstract = {The high number of planet discoveries made in the last years provides a good sample for statistical analysis, leading to some clues on the distributions of planet parameters, like masses and periods, at least in close proximity to the host star. We likely need to wait for the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) to have an overall view of the extrasolar planetary systems. In this context it would be useful to have a tool that can be used for the interpretation of the present results,and also to predict what the outcomes would be of the future instruments. For this reason we built MESS: a Monte Carlo simulation code which uses either the results of the statistical analysis of the properties of discovered planets, or the results of the planet formation theories, to build synthetic planet populations fully described in terms of frequency, orbital elements and physical properties. They can then be used to either test the consistency of their properties with the observed population of planets given different detection techniques or to actually predict the expected number of planets for future surveys. In addition to the code description, we present here some of its applications to actually probe the physical and orbital properties of a putative companion within the circumstellar disk of a given star and to test constrain the orbital distribution properties of a potential planet population around the members of the TW Hydrae association. Finally, using in its predictive mode, the synergy of future space and ground-based telescopes instrumentation has been investigated to identify the mass-period parameter space that will be probed in future surveys for giant and rocky planets},

abstract = {Brown Dwarfs are the coolest class of stellar objects known to date. Our present perception is that Brown Dwarfs follow the principles of star formation, and that Brown Dwarfs share many characteristics with planets. Being the darkest and lowest mass stars known makes Brown Dwarfs also the coolest stars known. This has profound implication for their spectral fingerprints. Brown Dwarfs cover a range of effective temperatures which cause brown dwarfs atmospheres to be a sequence that gradually changes from a M-dwarf-like spectrum into a planet-like spectrum. This further implies that below an effective temperature of {\textless} 2800K, clouds form already in atmospheres of objects marking the boundary between M-Dwarfs and brown dwarfs. Recent developments have sparked the interest in plasma processes in such very cool atmospheres: sporadic and quiescent radio emission has been observed in combination with decaying Xray-activity indicators across the fully convective boundary.},

As part of the survey, we observed 54 objects, consisting of 45 close, young stars; two more distant ({\textless}150 pc), extremely young ({\textless}=10 Myr) stars; three stars with known radial velocity planets; and four older, very nearby ({\textless}=20 pc) solar analogs. Our SDI devices use a double Wollaston prism and a quad filter to take images simultaneously at three wavelengths surrounding the 1.62 $\mu$m methane absorption bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giant planets. By differencing adaptive optics-corrected images in these filters, speckle noise from the primary star is significantly attenuated, resulting in photon (and flat-field)-noise-limited data. In our VLT data, we achieved H-band contrasts{\textgreater}{\~{}}10 mag (5 $\sigma$) at a separation of 0.5" from the primary star on 45{\%} of our targets and H-band contrasts{\textgreater}{\~{}}9 mag at a separation of 0.5" on 80{\%} of our targets.

We also present 131 FGKM standard stars, all of which exhibit constant radial velocity for at least 10 years, with an RMS less than 0.03 km/s. All velocities are measured relative to the solar system barycenter. Spectra of the Sun and of asteroids pin the zero-point of our velocities, yielding a velocity accuracy of 0.01 km/s for G2V stars. This velocity zero-point agrees within 0.01 $\backslash$kms with the zero-points carefully determined by Nidever et al. (2002) and Latham et al. (2002). For reference we compute the differences in velocity zero-points between our velocities and standard stars of the IAU, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and l'Observatoire de Geneve, finding agreement with all of them at the level of 0.1 km/s. But our radial velocities (and those of all other groups) contain no corrections for convective blueshift or gravitational redshifts (except for G2V stars), leaving them vulnerable to systematic errors of 0.2 $\backslash$kms for K dwarfs and {\~{}}0.3 km/s for M dwarfs due to subphotospheric convection, for which we offer velocity corrections. The velocities here thus represent accurately the radial component of each star's velocity vector. The radial velocity standards presented here are designed to be useful as fundamental standards in astronomy. They may be useful for Gaia (Crifo et al. 2010, Gilmore et al. 2012{\}} and for dynamical studies of such systems as long-period binary stars, star clusters, Galactic structure, and nearby galaxies, as will be carried out by SDSS, RAVE, APOGEE, SkyMapper, HERMES, and LSST.},

abstract = {One of the mechanisms suggested for the L to T dwarf spectral type transition is the appearance of relatively cloud-free regions across the disk of brown dwarfs as they cool. The existence of partly cloudy regions has been supported by evidence for variability in dwarfs in the late L to early T spectral range, but no self-consistent atmosphere models of such partly cloudy objects have yet been constructed. Here we present a new approach for consistently modeling partly cloudy brown dwarfs and giant planets. We find that even a small fraction of cloud holes dramatically alter the atmospheric thermal profile, spectra, and photometric colors of a given object. With decreasing cloudiness objects briskly become bluer in J - K and brighten in J band, as is observed at the L/T transition. Model spectra of partly cloudy objects are similar to our models with globally homogenous, but thinner, clouds. Hence spectra alone may not be sufficient to distinguish partial cloudiness although variability and polarization measurements are potential observational signatures. Finally we note that partial cloud cover may be an alternative explanation for the blue L dwarfs.},

abstract = {We survey the basic principles of atmospheric dynamics relevant to explaining existing and future observations of exoplanets, both gas giant and terrestrial. Given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres, our approach is to emphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from Solar-System studies that are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets. We begin by presenting the hierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics, including the Navier-Stokes, primitive, shallow-water, and two-dimensional nondivergent models. We then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics, including the importance of planetary rotation, the concept of balance, and scaling arguments to show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-west banding on rotating planets. We next turn to issues specific to giant planets, including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures, the implications for their wind patterns, and mechanisms to pump their east-west jets. Hot Jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention, as these close-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. We then turn to the basic elements of circulation on terrestrial planets as inferred from Solar-System studies, including Hadley cells, jet streams, processes that govern the large-scale horizontal temperature contrasts, and climate, and we discuss how these insights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets. Although exoplanets surely possess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets in our Solar System, our guiding philosophy is that the multi-decade study of Solar-System planets reviewed here provides a foundation upon which our understanding of more exotic exoplanetary meteorology must build.},

abstract = {While brown dwarfs show similarities with stars in their early life, their spin evolution is much more akin to that of planets. We have used lightcurves from the K2 mission to measure new rotation periods for 18 young brown dwarfs in the Taurus star-forming region. Our sample spans masses from 0.02 to 0.08 Msol and has been characterised extensively in the past. To search for periods, we utilize three different methods (autocorrelation, periodogram, Gaussian Processes). The median period for brown dwarfs with disks is twice as long as for those without (3.1 vs. 1.6 d), a signature of rotational braking by the disk, albeit with small numbers. With an overall median period of 1.9 d, brown dwarfs in Taurus rotate slower than their counterparts in somewhat older (3-10 Myr) star-forming regions, consistent with spin-up of the latter due to contraction and angular momentum conservation, a clear sign that disk braking overall is inefficient and/or temporary in this mass domain. We confirm the presence of a linear increase of the typical rotation period as a function of mass in the sub-stellar regime. The rotational velocities, when calculated forward to the age of the solar system assuming angular momentum conservation, fit the known spin-mass relation for solar system planets and extra-solar planetary-mass objects. This spin-mass trend holds over six orders of magnitude in mass, including objects from several different formation paths. Our result implies that brown dwarfs by and large retain their primordial angular momentum through the first few Myr of their evolution.},

abstract = {We present SPIDERMAN, a fast code for calculating exoplanet phase curves and secondary eclipses with arbitrary surface brightness distributions in two dimensions. Using a geometrical algorithm, the code solves exactly the area of sections of the disc of the planet that are occulted by the star. The code is written in C with a user-friendly Python interface, and is optimised to run quickly, with no loss in numerical precision. Approximately 1000 models can be generated per second in typical use, making Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses practicable. The modular nature of the code allows easy comparison of the effect of multiple different brightness distributions for the dataset. As a test case we apply the code to archival data on the phase curve of WASP-43b using a physically motivated analytical model for the two dimensional brightness map. The model provides a good fit to the data; however, it overpredicts the temperature of the nightside. We speculate that this could be due to the presence of clouds on the nightside of the planet, or additional reflected light from the dayside. When testing a simple cloud model we find that the best fitting model has a geometric albedo of {\$}0.32 \backslashpm0.02{\$} and does not require a hot nightside. We also test for variation of the map parameters as a function of wavelength and find no statistically significant correlations.},

Surface gravity is a key parameter in the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs and this is the first large survey that aims to test the gravity dependence of variability properties. We do a full analysis of the spectral signatures of youth and assess the group membership probability of each target using membership tools from the literature. This results in a 30 object sample of young low-gravity brown dwarfs. Since we are lacking in objects with spectral types later than L9, we focus our statistical analysis on the L0-L8.5 objects. We find that the variability occurrence rate of L0-L8.5 low-gravity brown dwarfs in this survey is {\$}30{\^{}}{\{}+16{\}}{\_}{\{}-8{\}}\backslash{\%}{\$}.

abstract = {Rotational modulations of brown dwarfs have recently provided powerful constraints on the properties of ultra-cool atmospheres, including longitudinal and vertical cloud structures and cloud evolution. Furthermore, periodic light curves directly probe the rotational periods of ultra-cool objects. We present here, for the first time, time-resolved high-precision photometric measurements of a planetary-mass companion, 2M1207b. We observed the binary system with HST/WFC3 in two bands and with two spacecraft roll angles. Using point spread function-based photometry, we reach a nearly photon-noise limited accuracy for both the primary and the secondary. While the primary is consistent with a flat light curve, the secondary shows modulations that are clearly detected in the combined light curve as well as in different subsets of the data. The amplitudes are 1.36{\%} in the F125W and 0.78{\%} in the F160W filters, respectively. By fitting sine waves to the light curves, we find a consistent period of {\$}10.7{\^{}}{\{}+1.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.6{\}}{\$} hours and similar phases in both bands. The J- and H-band amplitude ratio of 2M1207b is very similar to a field brown dwarf that has identical spectral type but different J-H color. Importantly, our study also measures, for the first time, the rotation period for a directly imaged extra-solar planetary-mass companion.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of two nearby L dwarfs from our 2MASS proper-motion search, which uses multiepoch 2MASS observations covering {\~{}}4700 deg2 of sky. 2MASS J18212815+1414010 and 2MASS J21481628+4003593 were overlooked by earlier surveys due to their faint optical magnitudes and their proximity to the Galactic plane (10deg{\textless}=|b|{\textless}=15°). Assuming that both dwarfs are single, we derive spectrophotometric distances of {\~{}}10 pc, thus increasing the number of known L dwarfs within 10 pc to 10. In the near-infrared, 2MASS J21481628+4003593 shows a triangular H-band spectrum, strong CO absorption, and a markedly red J-Ks color (2.38+/-0.06) for its L6 optical spectral type. 2MASS J18212815+1414010 also shows a triangular H-band spectrum and a slightly red J-Ks color (1.78+/-0.05) for its L4.5 optical spectral type. Both objects show strong silicate absorption at 9-11 $\mu$m. Cumulatively, these features imply an unusually dusty photosphere for both of these objects. We examine several scenarios to explain the underlying cause for their enhanced dust content and find that a metal-rich atmosphere or a low surface gravity are consistent with these results. 2MASS J18212815+1414010 may be young (and therefore have a low surface gravity) based on its low tangential velocity of 10 km s-1. On the other hand, 2MASS J21481628+4003593 has a high tangential velocity of 62 km s-1 and is therefore likely old. Hence, high metallicity and low surface gravity may lead to similar effects.

abstract = {We have monitored twelve T dwarfs with the Kitt Peak 2.1m telescope using an f814w filter (0.7-0.95 microns) to place in context the remarkable 10-20{\%} variability exhibited by the nearby T dwarf Luhman 16B in this wavelength regime. The motivation was the poorly known red optical behavior of T dwarfs, which have been monitored almost exclusively at infrared wavelengths, where variability amplitudes greater than 10{\%} have been found to be very rare. We detect highly significant variability in two T dwarfs. The T2.5 dwarf 2MASS 13243559+6358284 shows consistent {\~{}}17{\%} variability on two consecutive nights. The T2 dwarf 2MASS J16291840+0335371 exhibits {\~{}}10{\%} variability that may evolve from night to night, similarly to Luhman 16B. Both objects were previously known to be variable in the infrared, but with considerably lower amplitudes. We also find evidence for variability in the T6 dwarf J162414.37+002915.6, but since it has lower significance, we conservatively refrain from claiming this object as a variable. We explore and rule out various telluric effects, demonstrating that the variations we detect are astrophysically real. We suggest that high-amplitude photometric variability for T dwarfs is likely more common in the red optical than at longer wavelengths. The two new members of the growing class of high-amplitude variable T dwarfs offer excellent prospects for further study of cloud structures and their evolution.},

abstract = {Spectra of exoplanet atmospheres provide us the opportunity to improve our understanding of these objects just as remote sensing in our own solar system has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances allowed by the data. This challenge is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra which commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of temperature and abundance retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation we compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo. We call our suite of retrieval algorithms the Caltech Inverse Modeling and Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMERA). We discuss what we can expect in terms of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current observations as well as potential future observations and what conclusions can be drawn given those uncertainties. In general we find that the three approaches agree for high quality spectra expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low quality spectra representative of current observations. We also show that the Gaussian posterior probability distribution assumption made in the Optimal Estimation approach is valid for high quality spectral data. We also discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C to O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres, which of course are important for understanding formation environments. More specifically we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased towards values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.},

abstract = {Stellar coronal activity has been shown to persist into the low-mass star regime, down to late M-dwarf spectral types. However, there is now an accumulation of evidence suggesting that at the end of the main sequence there is a transition in the nature of the magnetic activity from chromospheric and coronal to planet-like and auroral, from local impulsive heating via flares and MHD wave dissipation to energy dissipation from strong large-scale magnetospheric current systems. We examine this transition and the prevalence of auroral activity in brown dwarfs through a compilation of multi-wavelength surveys of magnetic activity, including radio, X-ray, and optical. We compile the results of those surveys and place their conclusions in the context of auroral emission as the consequence of large-scale magnetospheric current systems that accelerate energetic electron beams and drive the particles to impact the cool atmospheric gas. We explore the different manifestation of auroral phenomena in brown dwarf atmospheres, like H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}, and define their distinguishing characteristics. We conclude that large amplitude photometric variability in the near infrared is most likely a consequence of clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres, but that auroral activity may be responsible for long-lived stable surface features. We report a connection between auroral H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission and quiescent radio emission in ECMI pulsing brown dwarfs, suggesting a potential underlying physical connection between the quiescent and auroral emissions. We also discuss the electrodynamic engines powering brown dwarf aurorae and the possible role of satellites around these systems to both power the aurorae and seed the magnetosphere with plasma.},

abstract = {We present the results of numerical experiments to assess degeneracies in lightcurve models of starspots. Using synthetic lightcurves generated with the Cheetah starspot modeling code, we explore the extent to which photometric light curves constrain spot model parameters, including spot latitudes and stellar inclination. We also investigate the effects of spot parameters and differential rotation on one's ability to correctly recover rotation periods and differential rotation in the Kepler lightcurves. We confirm that in the absence of additional constraints on the stellar inclination, such as spectroscopic measurements of vsini or occultations of starspots by planetary transits, the spot latitude and stellar inclination are difficult to determine uniquely from the photometry alone. We find that for models with no differential rotation, spots that appear on opposite hemispheres of the star may cause one to interpret the rotation period to be half of the true period. When differential rotation is included, the changing longitude separation between spots breaks the symmetry of the hemispheres and the correct rotation period is more likely to be found. The dominant period found via periodogram analysis is typically that of the largest spot. Even when multiple spots with periods representative of the star's differential rotation exist, if one spot dominates the lightcurve the signal of differential rotation may not be detectable from the periodogram alone. Starspot modeling is applicable to stars with a wider range of rotation rates than other surface imaging techniques (such as Doppler imaging), allows subtle signatures of differential rotation to be measured, and may provide valuable information on the distribution of stellar spots. However, given the inherent degeneracies and uncertainty present in starspot models, caution should be exercised in their interpretation.},

abstract = {The search for habitable and inhabited environments beyond our planet commonly focuses on analogs to Earth, especially in the case of exoplanets. Observations from ground-based facilities, satellites, and spacecraft have yielded a rich collection of data that can be used to effectively view a distant Earth within the context of exoplanet characterization. Application of planetary and exoplanetary remote sensing techniques to these datasets then enables the development of approaches to detecting signatures of habitability and life on other worlds. In addition, an array of models have also been used to simulate exoplanet-like datasets for the distant Earth, thereby providing insights that are often complementary to those from existing observations. Of course, Earth's atmosphere and surface environment has evolved substantially in the 4.5 billion years since our planet formed. A combination of in situ geological and bio-geochemical modeling studies of our planet have provided glimpses of environments that, while technically bellonging to our Earth, are seemingly alien worlds. Understanding the myriad ways Earth has been habitable and inhabited, coupled with remote sensing approaches honed on the distant Earth, provides a key guide to recognizing potentially life-bearing environments in distant planetary systems.},

abstract = {Barnard's star is a red dwarf, and has the largest proper motion (apparent motion across the sky) of all known stars. At a distance of 1.8 parsecs 1 , it is the closest single star to the Sun; only the three stars in the $\alpha$ Centauri system are closer. Barnard's star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known 2,3 and has an estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques with different sensitivity limits have been used previously, including radial-velocity imaging 4-6 , astrometry 7,8 and direct imaging 9 , but all ultimately led to negative or null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet around Barnard's star is a cold super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth, orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220 milliarcseconds from Barnard's star, making it an excellent target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the future.},

The spectra have R≡$\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda${\~{}}2000 from 0.9 to 2.4 $\mu$m and R=2500-200 from 2.9 to 4.1 $\mu$m. These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L-band spectra. The near-infrared spectra are combined with previously published red-optical spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to {\~{}}0.6 $\mu$m. Prominent atomic and molecular absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Na, and K and 19 new weak CH4 absorption features in the H-band spectra of mid- to late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0-0 band of the A 4$\Pi$-X 4$\Sigma$- transition of VO at {\~{}}1.06 $\mu$m in the spectra of L dwarfs and the P- and R-branches of the $\nu$3 band of CH4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf. The equivalent widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type and are absent by a spectral type of {\~{}}L0, except for the 1.189 $\mu$m Fe I line, which persists to at least {\~{}}L3. We compute the bolometric luminosities of the dwarfs in our sample with measured parallaxes and find good agreement with previously published results that use L'-band photometry to account for the flux emitted from 2.5 to 3.6 $\mu$m. Finally, 2MASS J2224381-0158521 (L4.5) has an anomalously red spectrum and the strongest $\Delta$$\nu$=+2 CO bands in our sample. This may be indicative of unusually thick condensate clouds and/or low surface gravity.

abstract = {Exoplanets that orbit close to their host stars are much more highly irradiated than their Solar System counterparts. Understanding the thermal structures and appearances of these planets requires investigating how their atmospheres respond to such extreme stellar forcing. We present spectroscopic thermal emission measurements as a function of orbital phase ("phase-curve observations") for the highly-irradiated exoplanet WASP-43b spanning three full planet rotations using the Hubble Space Telescope. With these data, we construct a map of the planet's atmospheric thermal structure, from which we find large day-night temperature variations at all measured altitudes and a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure at all longitudes. We also derive a Bond albedo of 0.18 +0.07,-0.12 and an altitude dependence in the hot-spot offset relative to the substellar point.},

abstract = {Observing ROSAT sources in 20 x 25 deg centered at the high latitude active star ER Eri, we found evidences for a new young nearby association ({\~{}}30Myr at{\~{}}60pc), the Horologium Association (HorA), formed by at least 10 probable and 6 possible members, some being Post-T Tauri stars. We examine several requirements that characterize a young association and they, together, create a strong evidence for the reality of the HorA. In fact, the Li line intensities are between those of the oldest classical T Tauri stars and the ones of the Local Association stars. The space velocities of the HorA relative to the Sun, U= -9.5+/-1.0, V = -20.9 +/- 1.1, W = -2.1 +/- 1.9, are not far from those of the Local Association. We suggest that some hotter and non-X-ray active stars, with similar space velocities, could be massive members of the HorA, among them, the nearby Be star Achernar. The maximum of the mass distribution function of the HorA is around 0.8 solar masses. At its distance, the projected size of the HorA, {\~{}}50 pc, would be larger than our surveyed area and many other members could have been missed. We also observed 3 control regions, two at northern and southern galactic latitudes and a third one in the known TW Hya Association (TWA), and the properties and distribution of their young stars strengthen the reality of the HorA. Contrary to the TWA, the only known binaries in the HorA are 2 very wide systems. The HorA is much more isolated from clouds and older than the TWA and could give some clues about the lifetime of the disks around T Tauri stars. Actually, none of the proposed members is an IRAS source indicating an advanced stage of the evolution of their accreting disks. ER Eri itself was found to be a RS CVn-like system.},

HD 203030B offered the first clear indication that the effective temperature at the L-to-T spectral type transition depends on surface gravity: now a well-known characteristic of low-gravity ultra-cool dwarfs. An initial age analysis of the G8V primary star indicated that the system was 130--400 Myr old, and so the companion between 12--31 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}. Using moderate resolution near-infrared spectra of HD 203030B, we now find features of very low gravity comparable to those of 10--150 Myr-old L7--L8 dwarfs.

We further reassess the evidence for the young age of the host star, HD 203030, with a more comprehensive analysis of the photometry and updated stellar activity measurements and age calibrations. Summarizing the age diagnostics for both components of the binary, we adopt an age of 100 Myr for HD 203030B and an age range of 30--150 Myr. Using cloudy evolutionary models, the new companion age range and luminosity result in a mass of 11 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} with a range of 8--15 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}, and an effective temperature of {\$}1040\backslashpm50{\$} K.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined from spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision. Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a CO5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not reponsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis is Z=0.0153, Z/X=0.0209.},

abstract = {Recently, studies of brown dwarfs have demonstrated that they possess strong magnetic fields and have the potential to produce radio and optical auroral emissions powered by magnetospheric currents. This emission provides the only window on magnetic fields in the coolest brown dwarfs and identifying additional benchmark objects is key to constraining dynamo theory in this regime. To this end, we conducted a new red optical (6300 - 9700 Angstrom) survey with the Keck telescopes looking for H-alpha emission from a sample of late L dwarfs and T dwarfs. Our survey gathered optical spectra for 29 targets, 18 of which did not have previous optical spectra in the literature, greatly expanding the number of moderate resolution (R{\~{}}2000) spectra available at these spectral types. Combining our sample with previous surveys, we confirm an H-alpha detection rate of 9.2 (+3.5/-2.1) {\%} for L and T dwarfs in the optical spectral range of L4 - T8. This detection rate is consistent with the recently measured detection rate for auroral radio emission from Kao et al. (2016), suggesting that geometrical selection effects due to the beaming of the radio emission are small or absent. We also provide the first detection of H-alpha emission from 2MASS 0036+1821, previously notable as the only electron cyclotron maser radio source without a confirmed detection of H-alpha emission. Finally, we also establish optical standards for spectral types T3 and T4, filling in the previous gap between T2 and T5.},

The broad-band ZYJHK data are directly calibrated from Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) point sources which are abundant in every WFCAM pointing. We perform an analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and intradetector show that these are present at up to the {\~{}}5per cent level in WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a method for their removal is developed and tested. Following the application of the correction procedure, the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be accurate to {\~{}}=1.5per cent for the JHK bands and 2per cent for the ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibrations are sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B - V)', but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega system, and investigate WFCAM measurements of published standard stars from the list of UKIRT faint standards. Finally, we present empirically determined throughput measurements for WFCAM.},

abstract = {Condensate clouds are a salient feature of L dwarf atmospheres, but have been assumed to play little role in shaping the spectra of the coldest T-type brown dwarfs. Here we report evidence of condensate opacity in the near-infrared spectrum of the brown dwarf candidate Ross 458C, obtained with the Folded-Port Infrared Echellette (FIRE) spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes. These data verify the low-temperature nature of this source, indicating a T8 spectral classification, log Lbol/Lsun = -5.62+/-0.03, Teff = 650+/-25 K, and a mass at or below the deuterium burning limit. The data also reveal enhanced emission at K-band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity, reflecting the properties of the Ross 458 system (age = 150-800 Myr, [Fe/H] = +0.2 to +0.3). We present fits of FIRE data for Ross 458C, the T9 dwarf ULAS J133553.45+113005.2, and the blue T7.5 dwarf SDSS J141624.08+134826.7B, to cloudless and cloudy spectral models from Saumon {\&} Marley. For Ross 458C we confirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperature differs depending on the presence (635 [+25,-35] K) or absence (760 [+70,-45] K) of cloud extinction. ULAS J1335+1130 and SDSS J1416+1348B have similar temperatures (595 [+25,-45] K), but distinct surface gravities (log g = 4.0-4.5 cgs versus 5.0-5.5 cgs) and metallicities ([M/H] {\~{}} +0.2 versus -0.2). In all three cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data, significantly so for Ross 458C. These results indicate that clouds are an important opacity source in the spectra of young cold T dwarfs, and should be considered when characterizing the spectra of planetary-mass objects in young clusters and directly-imaged exoplanets. The characteristics of Ross 458C suggest it could itself be regarded as a planet, albeit one whose cosmogony does not conform with current planet formation theories.},

abstract = {Time-resolved photometry is an important new probe of the physics of condensate clouds in extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Extreme adaptive optics systems can directly image planets, but precise brightness measurements are challenging. We present VLT/SPHERE high-contrast, time-resolved broad H-band near-infrared photometry for four exoplanets in the HR 8799 system, sampling changes from night to night over five nights with relatively short integrations. The photospheres of these four planets are often modeled by patchy clouds and may show large-amplitude rotational brightness modulations. Our observations provide high-quality images of the system. We present a detailed performance analysis of different data analysis approaches to accurately measure the relative brightnesses of the four exoplanets. We explore the information in satellite spots and demonstrate their use as a proxy for image quality. While the brightness variations of the satellite spots are strongly correlated, we also identify a second-order anti-correlation pattern between the different spots. Our study finds that PCA-based KLIP reduction with satellite spot-modulated artificial planet-injection based photometry (SMAP) leads to a significant ({\~{}}3x) gain in photometric accuracy over standard aperture-based photometry and reaches 0.1 mag per point accuracy for our dataset, the signal-to-noise of which is limited by small field rotation. Relative planet-to-planet photometry can be compared be- tween nights, enabling observations spanning multiple nights to probe variability.

abstract = {Exoplanet research is carried out at the limits of the capabilities of current telescopes and instruments. The studied signals are weak, and often embedded in complex systematics from instrumental, telluric, and astrophysical sources. Combining repeated observations of periodic events, simultaneous observations with multiple telescopes, different observation techniques, and existing information from theory and prior research can help to disentangle the systematics from the planetary signals, and offers synergistic advantages over analysing observations separately. Bayesian inference provides a self-consistent statistical framework that addresses both the necessity for complex systematics models, and the need to combine prior information and heterogeneous observations. This chapter offers a brief introduction to Bayesian inference in the context of exoplanet research, with focus on time series analysis, and finishes with an overview of a set of freely available programming libraries.},

abstract = {The coldest brown dwarf, WISE 0855, is the closest known planetary-mass, free-floating object and has a temperature nearly as cold as the solar system gas giants. Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE 0855 is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer et al. 2016 presented a spectrum of WISE 0855 from 4.5-5.1 micron (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here, we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4-4.14 micron. We present a set of atmosphere models that include a range of compositions (metallicities and C/O ratios) and water ice clouds. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum. The mid-infrared color can be better matched with a methane abundance that is depleted relative to solar abundance. We find that there is evidence for water ice clouds in the M band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral features in both the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum opacity source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging the temperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible exoplanets. JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric dynamics and formation processes.},

abstract = {We use a simple organism lifecycle model to explore the viability of an atmospheric habitable zone (AHZ), with temperatures that could support Earth-centric life, which sits above an environment that does not support life. We illustrate this idea using the object WISE J085510.83-0714442.5, which is a cool, free-floating brown dwarf. We allow organisms to adapt to their atmospheric environment (described by temperature, convection, and gravity) by adopting different growth strategies that maximize their chance of survival and proliferation. We assume a constant upward vertical velocity through the AHZ. We found that the organism growth strategy is most sensitive to the magnitude of the atmospheric convection. Stronger convection supports the evolution of more massive organisms. For a purely radiative environment we find that evolved organisms have a mass that is an order of magnitude smaller than terrestrial microbes, thereby defining a dynamical constraint on the dimensions of life that an AHZ can support. Based on a previously defined statistical approach we infer that there are of order {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} Y brown dwarfs in the Milky Way, and likely a few tens of these objects are within ten parsecs from Earth. Our work also has implications for exploring life in the atmospheres of temperate gas giants. Consideration of the habitable volumes in planetary atmospheres significantly increases the volume of habitable space in the galaxy.},

abstract = {Rotational modulations are observed on brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we analyze Jupiter's rotational light curves at 12 wavelengths from the ultraviolet (UV) to the mid-infrared (mid-IR). Peak-to-peak amplitudes of Jupiter's light curves range from sub percent to 4{\%} at most wavelengths, but the amplitude exceeds 20{\%} at 5 {\$}\backslashrm \backslashmu m{\$}, a wavelength sensing Jupiter's deep troposphere. Jupiter's rotational modulations are primarily caused by discrete patterns in the cloudless belts instead of the cloudy zones. The light-curve amplitude is dominated by the sizes and brightness contrasts of the Great Red Spot (GRS), expansions of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), patchy clouds in the North Temperate Belt (NTB) and a train of hot spots in the NEB. In reflection, the contrast is controlled by upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes, clouds, and chromophores in the clouds. In thermal emission, the small rotational variability is caused by the spatial distribution of temperature and opacities of gas and aerosols; the large variation is caused by the {\$}\backslashrm NH{\_}{\{}3{\}}{\$} cloud holes and thin-thick clouds. The methane-band light curves exhibit opposite-shape behavior compared with the UV and visible wavelengths, caused by wavelength-dependent brightness change of the GRS. Light-curve evolution is induced by periodic events in the belts and longitudinal drifting of the GRS and patchy clouds in the NTB. This study suggests several interesting mechanisms related to distributions of temperature, gas, hazes, and clouds for understanding the observed rotational modulations on brown dwarfs and exoplanets.},

abstract = {We investigate to what extent the spin axes of stars in young open clusters are aligned. Assuming that the spin vectors lie uniformly within a conical section, with an opening half-angle between lambda=0 (perfectly aligned) and lambda=90 degrees(completely random), we describe a Monte-Carlo modelling technique that returns a probability density for this opening angle given a set of measured sin i values, where i is the unknown inclination angle between a stellar spin vector and the line of sight. Using simulations we demonstrate that although azimuthal information is lost, it is easily possible to discriminate between strongly aligned spin axes and a random distribution, providing that the mean spin-axis inclination lies outside the range 45--75 degrees. We apply the technique to G- and K-type stars in the young Pleiades and Alpha Per clusters. The sin i values are derived using rotation periods and projected equatorial velocities, combined with radii estimated from the cluster distances and a surface brightness/colour relationship. For both clusters we find no evidence for spin-axis alignment: lambda=90 degrees is the most probable model and lambda{\textgreater}40 degrees with 90 per cent confidence. Assuming a random spin-axis alignment, we re-determine the distances to both clusters, obtaining 133+/-7pc for the Pleiades and 182+/-11 pc for Alpha Per. If the assumption of random spin-axis alignment is discarded however, whilst the distance estimate remains unchanged, it has an additional +18/-32 percent uncertainty.},

The interior of the most massive brown dwarfs is shown to develop a conductive core T eff [ 2800 after D2 Gyr which slows down their cooling. Comparison is made in optical and infrared color-magnitude diagrams with recent late-M and L dwarf observations. The saturation in optical colors and the very red near-infrared colors of these objects are well explained by the onset of dust formation in the atmosphere. Comparison of the faintest presently observed L dwarfs with these dusty evolutionary models suggests that dynamical processes such as turbulent di usion and gravitational settling are taking place near the photosphere. As the e ective temperature decreases below K, the colors T eff B 1300{\`{E}}1400 of these objects move to very blue near-infrared colors, a consequence of the ongoing methane absorp-tion in the infrared.

Near-IR spectroscopy shows a spectral type of L7 and reveals a triangular H-band continuum and weak alkali (K I and Na I) lines, hallmarks of low surface gravity. Near-IR astrometry from the Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program gives a distance of 24.6+/-1.4 pc and indicates a much fainter J-band absolute magnitude than field L dwarfs. The position and kinematics of PSO J318-22 point to membership in the beta Pictoris moving group. Evolutionary models give a temperature of 1160 (-40,+30) K and a mass of 6.5 (-1.0, +1.3) Mjup, making PSO J318-22 one of the lowest mass free-floating objects in the solar neighborhood. This object adds to the growing list of low-gravity field L dwarfs and is the first to be strongly deficient in methane relative to its estimated temperature. Comparing their spectra suggests that young L dwarfs with similar ages and temperatures can have different spectral signatures of youth. For the two objects with well constrained ages (PSO J318-22 and 2MASS J0355+11), we find their temperatures are {\~{}}400 K cooler than field objects of similar spectral type but their luminosities are comparable, i.e., these young L dwarfs are very red and unusually cool but not "underluminous."

These data are supplemented by existing red and near-infrared spectra ({\~{}}0.6-2.5 $\mu$m), as well as red through mid-infrared spectroscopy of seven other L and T dwarfs presented by Cushing et al. We compare these spectra to those generated from the model atmospheres of Saumon {\&} Marley. The models reproduce the observed spectra well, except in the case of one very red L3.5 dwarf, 2MASS J22244381-0158521. The broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almost independently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in our models: effective temperature (T eff), surface gravity, grain sedimentation efficiency (f sed), and vertical gas transport efficiency (Kzz ). The CH4 bands centered at 2.2, 3.3, and 7.65 $\mu$m and the CO band at 2.3 $\mu$m are sensitive to Kzz , and indicates that chemical mixing is important in all L and T dwarf atmospheres. The sample of L3.5 to T5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 Kgsim T eff gsim1000 K, with an L-T transition (spectral types L7 to T4) that lies between 1400 and 1100 K for dwarfs with typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 K warmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. When using optical spectral types, the bluer dwarfs have more typical T eff values as they tend to have earlier optical spectral types. In this model analysis, f sed increases rapidly between types T0 and T4, indicating that increased sedimentation can explain the rapid disappearance of clouds at this stage of brown dwarf evolution. There is a suggestion that the transition to dust-free atmospheres happens at lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.},

abstract = {We have carried out a sensitive high-resolution imaging survey of stars in the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster around $\eta$ Chamaeleontis to search for stellar and substellar companions. Our data were obtained using the NACO adaptive optics system on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). Given its youth and proximity, any substellar companions are expected to be luminous, especially in the near-infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars. Here, we present VLT NACO adaptive optics imaging with companion detection limits for 17 $\eta$ Cha cluster members, and follow-up VLT ISAAC near-infrared spectroscopy for companion candidates. The widest binary detected is {\~{}}0.2", corresponding to the projected separation 20 AU, despite our survey being sensitive down to substellar companions outside 0.3", and planetary-mass objects outside 0.5". This implies that the stellar companion probability outside 0.3" and the brown dwarf companion probability outside 0.5" are less than 0.16 with 95{\%} confidence. We compare the wide binary frequency of $\eta$ Cha to that of the similarly aged TW Hydrae association and estimate the statistical likelihood that the wide binary probability is equal in both groups to be less than 2×10-4. Even though the $\eta$ Cha cluster is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its present configuration cannot account for the relative deficit of wide binaries. We thus conclude that the difference in wide binary probability in these two groups provides strong evidence for multiplicity properties being dependent on environment. In two appendices we derive the projected separation probability distribution for binaries, used to constrain physical separations from observed projected separations, and summarize statistical tools useful for multiplicity studies.},

We are engaged in a multifaceted search for nearby late-type objects, and this is the first installment of our search using purely photometric selection. The goal of this work is a determination of the low-mass star and brown dwarf luminosity function in the infrared. Here we outline the construction of the sample, dubbed 2MU2, and present our first results, including the discovery of 186 M7-L6 dwarfs-47 of which are likely to be within 20 pc of the Sun. These results represent 66{\%} of the ultracool candidates in our sample yet constitute a 127{\%} increase in the number of ultracool dwarfs known within the volume searched (covering 40{\%} of the sky out to 20 pc). In addition, we have identified 10 M4-M6.5 objects that are likely to be within 20 pc (or within 1 sigma). Finally, based on these initial data, we present a preliminary luminosity function and discuss several interesting features of the partial sample presented here. Once our sample is complete, we will use our measured luminosity function to constrain the mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {We present initial results from a wide-field (30,000 deg{\^{}}2) search for L/T transition brown dwarfs within 25 pc using the Pan-STARRS1 and WISE surveys. Previous large-area searches have been incomplete for L/T transition dwarfs, because these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colors that are difficult to distinguish from background stars. To overcome these obstacles, we have cross-matched the Pan-STARRS1 (optical) and WISE (mid-IR) catalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracool dwarfs. As part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven brown dwarfs in the L/T transition within 9-15 pc of the Sun. The L9.5 dwarf PSO J140.2308+45.6487 and the T1.5 dwarf PSO J307.6784+07.8263 (both independently discovered by Mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at the Y- and J-bands. Two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometric J-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based on their spectra. We expect our full search to yield a well-defined, volume-limited sample of L/T transition dwarfs that will include many new targets for study of this complex regime. PSO J307.6784+07.8263 in particular may be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given its brightness (J = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc).},

This source was previously reported to be an M giant star based on its unusual near-infrared spectrum and lack of measurable proper motion.

abstract = {We present JHKs photometry, far red spectra, and spectral classifications for an additional 67 L dwarfs discovered by the Two Micron All Sky Survey. One of the goals of this new search was to locate more examples of the latest L dwarfs. Of the 67 new discoveries, 17 have types of L6 or later. Analysis of these new discoveries shows that H$\alpha$ emission has yet to be convincingly detected in any L dwarf later than type L4.5, indicating a decline or absence of chromospheric activity in the latest L dwarfs. Further analysis shows that 16 (and possibly four more) of the new L dwarfs are lithium brown dwarfs and that the average line strength for those L dwarfs showing lithium increases until type {\~{}}L6.5 V, then declines for later types. This disappearance may be the first sign of depletion of atomic lithium as it begins to form into lithium-bearing molecules. Another goal of the search was to locate nearer, brighter L dwarfs of all subtypes. Using absolute magnitudes for 17 L dwarf systems with trigonometric parallax measurements, we develop spectrophotometric relations to estimate distances to the other L dwarfs. Of the 67 new discoveries, 21 have photometric distances placing them within 25 pc of the Sun. A table of all known L and T dwarfs believed to lie within 25 pc-53 in total - is also presented. Using the distance measurement of the coolest L dwarf known, we calculate that the gap in temperature between L8 and the warmest known T dwarfs is less than 350 K and probably much less. If the transition region between the two classes spans a very small temperature interval, this would explain why no transition objects have yet been uncovered. This evidence, combined with model fits to low-resolution spectra of late M and early L dwarfs, indicates that L-class objects span the range 1300 K{\textless}{\~{}}Teff{\textless}{\~{}}2000 K. The near-infrared color-color diagram shows that L dwarfs fall along a natural, redder extension of the well-known M dwarf track. These near-infrared colors get progressively redder for later spectral types, with the L dwarf sequence abruptly ending near (J-H, H-Ks, J-Ks){\~{}}(1.3,0.8,2.1). Portions of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis for Nearby Young AssociatioNs II (BANYAN II), a modified Bayesian analysis for assessing the membership of later-than-M5 objects to any of several Nearby Young Associations (NYAs). In addition to using kinematic information (from sky position and proper motion), this analysis exploits 2MASS-WISE color-magnitude diagrams in which old and young objects follow distinct sequences. As an improvement over our earlier work, the spatial and kinematic distributions for each association are now modelled as ellipsoids whose axes need not be aligned with the Galactic coordinate axes, and we use prior probabilities matching the expected populations of the NYAs considered versus field stars. We present an extensive contamination analysis to characterize the performance of our new method. We find that Bayesian probabilities are generally representative of contamination rates, except when a parallax measurement is considered. In this case contamination rates become significantly smaller and hence Bayesian probabilities for NYA memberships are pessimistic. We apply this new algorithm to a sample of 158 objects from the literature that are either known to display spectroscopic signs of youth or have unusually red near-infrared colors for their spectral type. Based on our analysis, we identify 25 objects as new highly probable candidates to NYAs, including a new M7.5 bona fide member to Tucana-Horologium, making it the latest-type member. In addition, we reveal that a known L2{\{}$\backslash$gamma{\}} dwarf is co-moving with a bright M5 dwarf, and we show for the first time that two of the currently known ultra red L dwarfs are strong candidates to the AB Doradus moving group. Several objects identified here as highly probable members to NYAs could be free-floating planetary-mass objects if their membership is confirmed.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of 2MASS J11263991-5003550 identified as part of an ongoing survey to discover ultracool dwarfs in the Southern Galactic plane, using data from the 2MASS and SuperCOSMOS Sky Surveys. Strong FeH and H2O features in the near-infrared JH-band spectrum reveal characteristics seen in both mid-L and L-T transition type dwarfs. We suggest these may be attributable to holes in the condensate cloud layers in the atmosphere of a single substellar object, but cannot at present completely rule out the role of binarity as the possible cause. We also identify this object as a blue L dwarf, and explore the similar observable characteristics of these objects with those of the L-T transition. From this comparison we suggest that the temperature (and thus spectral type) at which the condensate cloud layer begins to break up/rain out, may be highly sensitive to small variations in metallicity. However, the JH-band spectrum of this object does not resemble that of the known L subdwarfs, and therefore extreme metal deficiency may not in fact be responsible for the discordant features. We estimate a spectral type of L9 +/- 1, and measure a large proper motion of $\mu$(tot) = 1.65 +/- 0.03 arcsecyr-1. Also, a spectrophotometric distance of 8.2pc is estimated, possibly making this object the nearest easily observable single L-T transition object in the Southern hemisphere.

The calculation of the modified periodogram for unevenly sampled data is reviewed. The proper definition of the variance that is used to normalize the power of the modified periodogram is clarified. It is proven that the probability that a peak in the periodogram is noise or signal can be easily assessed by the method given here only when the total variance of the data is used to normalize the periodogram power. The crucial choice of independent frequencies in calculating both the periodogram and the false alarm probability from unevenly sampled data is discussed. An empirical formula for estimating the number of independent frequencies is derived. In addition, the formula for the uncertainty of a frequency identified in the periodogram is reviewed. A method for detecting the presence of an alias frequency caused by the interaction of the window and signal is prescribed. With some examples of periodic signals, the minimum number of points required to measure reliably a signal are shown. The signal-to-noise ratio and the number of points required to extract signals when one or two periodicities are present in the time series are investigated.},

Our TVLM 513-46546 photometry includes 2 nights of simultaneous, multiwavelength, ground-based photometry, in which we detect obvious J-band variability, but do not detect I-band variability of similar amplitude, confirming that the variability of TVLM 513-46546 most likely arises from clouds or aurorae, rather than starspots. Our photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 includes 15 nights of J-band photometry that allow us to observe how the variable light curve of this L/T transition brown dwarf evolves from rotation period to rotation period, night-to-night and week-to-week. We estimate the rotation period of SIMP J013656.5+093347 as 2.406 +/- 0.008 hours, and do not find evidence for obvious differential rotation. The peak-to-peak amplitude displayed by SIMP J013656.5+093347 in our light curves evolves from greater than 6{\%} to less than 1{\%} in a matter of days, and the typical timescale for significant evolution of the SIMP J013656.5+093347 light curve appears to be approximately {\textless}1 to 10 rotation periods. This suggests that those performing spectrophotometric observations of brown dwarfs should be cautious in their interpretations comparing the spectra between a variable brown dwarf's maximum flux and minimum flux from observations lasting only approximately a rotation period, as these comparisons may depict the spectral characteristics of a single, ephemeral snapshot, rather than the full range of characteristics.},

This dust haze would exist in conjunction with the clouds found in dwarfs with more typical colors. We developed a model which uses Mie theory and the Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the proposed dust haze. We apply our method to 23 young L dwarfs and 23 red field L dwarfs. We constrain the properties of the dust haze including particle size distribution and column density using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. We find that sub-micron range silicate grains reproduce the observed reddening. Current brown dwarf atmosphere models include large grain (1--100{\~{}}{\$}\backslashmu m{\$}) dust clouds but not submicron dust grains. Our results provide a strong proof of concept and motivate a combination of large and small dust grains in brown dwarf atmosphere models.},

abstract = {Because WISE J085510.83{\$}-{\$}071442.5 (hereafter WISE 0855-0714) is the coldest known brown dwarf ({\$}\backslashsim250{\$} K) and one of the Sun's closest neighbors (2.2 pc), it offers a unique opportunity for studying a planet-like atmosphere in an unexplored regime of temperature. To detect and characterize inhomogeneities in its atmosphere (e.g., patchy clouds, hot spots), we have performed time-series photometric monitoring of WISE 0855-0714 at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer Space Telescope during two 23{\~{}}hr periods that were separated by several months. For both bands, we have detected variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 4-5{\%} and 3-4{\%} in the first and second epochs, respectively. The light curves are semi-periodic in the first epoch for both bands, but are more irregular in the second epoch. Models of patchy clouds have predicted a large increase in mid-IR variability amplitudes (for a given cloud covering fraction) with the appearance of water ice clouds at {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\textless}{\$}375 K, so if such clouds are responsible for the variability of WISE 0855-0714, then its small amplitudes of variability indicate a very small deviation in cloud coverage between hemispheres. Alternatively, the similarity in mid-IR variability amplitudes between WISE 0855-0714 and somewhat warmer T and Y dwarfs may suggest that they share a common origin for their variability (i.e., not water clouds). In addition to our variability data, we have examined other constraints on the presence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of WISE 0855-0714, including the recent mid-IR spectrum from $\backslash$citet{\{}ske16{\}}. We find that robust evidence of such clouds is not yet available.},

abstract = {WISE J104915.57-531906.1 is a candidate L/T brown dwarf binary located 2pc from the Sun. The pair contains the closest known brown dwarfs and is the third closest known system, stellar or sub-stellar. Here we report the first comprehensive follow-up observations of this newly uncovered system. We have determined the spectral types of both components (L8+/-1, T1+/-2) and their radial velocities (V{\_}rad{\~{}}23.1, 19.5 km/s) using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and other facilities located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). The relative radial velocity of the two components is smaller than the range of orbital velocities for theoretically predicted masses, implying that they form a gravitationally bound system. We report resolved near-infrared {\$}JHK{\_}S{\$} photometry from the IRSF telescope at the SAAO which yields colors consistent with the spectroscopically derived spectral types. Our apparent magnitudes predict a distance of {\~{}}2.25pc, similar to the previous measurement. The available kinematic and photometric information excludes the possibility that the object belongs to any of the known nearby young moving groups or associations. Simultaneous optical polarimetry observations taken at the SAAO 1.9-m give a non-detection with an upper limit of 0.07{\%}. For the given spectral types and absolute magnitudes, 1Gyr theoretical models predict masses of 0.04--0.05$\backslash$,M{\_}odot for the primary, and 0.03--0.05$\backslash$,M{\_}odot for the secondary. The objects remain in the sub-stellar regime even if they are 10Gyr old.},

abstract = {We identify new Y- and T-type brown dwarfs from the WISE All Sky data release using images obtained in filters that divide the traditional near-infrared H and J bands into two halves -- specifically CH4s {\&} CH4l in the H and J2 {\&} J3 in the J. This proves to be very effective at identifying cool brown dwarfs via the detection of their methane absorption, as well as providing preliminary classification using methane colours and WISE-to-near-infrared colours. New and updated calibrations between T/Y spectral types and CH4s-CH4l, J3-W2, and CH4s-W2 colours are derived, producing classification estimates good to a few spectral sub-types. We present photometry for a large sample of T and Y dwarfs in these filters, together with spectroscopy for 23 new ultra-cool dwarfs - two Y dwarfs and twenty one T dwarfs. We identify a further 8 new cool brown dwarfs, which we have high confidence are T dwarfs based on their methane photometry. We find that, for objects observed on a 4m-class telescope at J band magnitudes of {\~{}}20 or brighter, CH4s-CH4l is the more powerful colour for detecting objects and then estimating spectral types. Due to the lower sky background in the J-band, the J3 and J2 bands are more useful for identifying fainter cool dwarfs at J{\textgreater}22. The J3-J2 colour is poor at estimating spectral types. But fortunately, once J3-J2 confirms that an object is a cool dwarf, the J3-W2 colour is very effective at estimating approximate spectral types.},

abstract = {We present Keck HIRES spectra of 6 late-M dwarfs and 11 L dwarfs. Our goal is to assign effective temperatures to the objects using detailed atmospheric models and fine analysis of the alkali resonance absorption lines of CsI and RbI. These yield mutually consistent results (+-150 K) when we use ``cleared-dust'' models, which account for the removal of refractory species from the molecular states but do not include dust opacities. We find a tendency for the RbI line to imply a slightly higher temperature, which we ascribe to an incomplete treatment of the overlying molecular opacities. The final effective temperatures we adopt are based on the CsI fits alone, though the RbI fits support the CsI temperature sequence. This work, in combination with results from the infrared, hints that dust in these atmospheres has settled out of the high atmosphere but is present in the deep photosphere. We also derive radial and rotational velocities for all the objects, finding that the previously discovered trend of rapid rotation for very low mass objects is quite pervasive. To improve on our analysis, there is a clear need for better molecular line lists and a more detailed understanding of dust formation and dynamics.},

abstract = {The quest for other habitable worlds and the search for life among them are major goals of modern astronomy. One way to make progress towards these goals is to obtain high-quality spectra of a large number of exoplanets over a broad range of wavelengths. While concepts currently investigated in the United States are focused on visible/NIR wavelengths, where the planets are probed in reflected light, a compelling alternative to characterize planetary atmospheres is the mid-infrared waveband (5-20{\~{}}{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m). Indeed, mid-infrared observations provide key information on the presence of an atmosphere, the surface conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, habitability), and the atmospheric composition in important species such as H{\$}{\_}2{\$}O, CO{\$}{\_}2{\$}, O{\$}{\_}3{\$}, CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}, and N{\$}{\_}2{\$}O. This information is essential to investigate the potential habitability of exoplanets and to make progress towards the search for life in the universe. Obtaining high-quality mid-infrared spectra of exoplanets from the ground is however extremely challenging due to the overwhelming brightness and turbulence of Earth's atmosphere. In this paper, we present a concept of space-based mid-infrared interferometer that can tackle this observing challenge and discuss the main technological developments required to launch such a sophisticated instrument.},

abstract = {The substellar companion HD206893b has recently been discovered by direct imaging of its disc-bearing host star with the SPHERE instrument. We investigate the atypical properties of the companion, which has the reddest near-infrared colours among all known substellar objects, either orbiting a star or isolated, and we provide a comprehensive characterisation of the host star-disc-companion system. We conducted a follow-up of the companion with adaptive optics imaging and spectro-imaging with SPHERE, and a multiinstrument follow-up of its host star. We obtain a R=30 spectrum from 0.95 to 1.64 micron of the companion and additional photometry at 2.11 and 2.25 micron. We carried out extensive atmosphere model fitting for the companions and the host star in order to derive their age, mass, and metallicity. We found no additional companion in the system in spite of exquisite observing conditions resulting in sensitivity to 6MJup (2MJup) at 0.5" for an age of 300 Myr (50 Myr). We detect orbital motion over more than one year and characterise the possible Keplerian orbits. We constrain the age of the system to a minimum of 50 Myr and a maximum of 700 Myr, and determine that the host-star metallicity is nearly solar. The comparison of the companion spectrum and photometry to model atmospheres indicates that the companion is an extremely dusty late L dwarf, with an intermediate gravity (log g 4.5-5.0) which is compatible with the independent age estimate of the system. Though our best fit corresponds to a brown dwarf of 15-30 MJup aged 100-300 Myr, our analysis is also compatible with a range of masses and ages going from a 50 Myr 12MJup planetary-mass object to a 50 MJup Hyades-age brown dwarf...},

Using low-gravity spectral signatures as age indicators, we observed and analyzed J-band and optical spectra of two young brown dwarfs, G196-3B (20-300 Myr) and KPNO Tau 4 (1-2 Myr) and two possible low-mass brown dwarfs in the $\sigma$ Orionis cluster (3-7 Myr). We report the identification of the $\phi$ bands of TiO near 1.24 $\mu$m and the A-X band of VO near 1.18 $\mu$m together with extremely weak J-band lines of K I in KPNO Tau 4. This is the first detection of TiO and VO in the J band in a substellar-mass object. The optical spectrum of KPNO Tau 4 exhibits weak K I and Na I lines, weak absorption by CaH, and strong VO bands, also signatures of a lower gravity atmosphere. G196-3B shows absorption features in both wavelength regions, like those of KPNO Tau 4, suggesting that its age and mass are at the lower end of published estimates. Whereas $\sigma$ Ori 51 appears to be consistent with a young substellar object, $\sigma$ Ori 47 shows signatures of high gravity most closely resembling an old L1.5/L0 and cannot be a member of the $\sigma$ Orionis cluster.},

abstract = {We present the results of a new series of nongray calculations of the atmospheres, spectra, colors, and evolution of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs for effective temperatures below 1300 K. This theory encompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects and is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of the multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant planets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class. Generically, absorption by H2 at longer wavelengths and H2O opacity windows at shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K, methane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic feature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which to search are Z ({\~{}}1.05 mu m), J ({\~{}}1.2 mu m), H ({\~{}}1.6 mu m), K ({\~{}}2.2 mu m), M ({\~{}}5 mu m), and N ({\~{}}10 mu m), that enhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the near infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors of EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In particular, relative to J and H, the K band flux is reduced by CH4 and H2 absorption. Furthermore, we conclude that for Teff's below 1200 K most or all true metals may be sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior radiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of H2O and NH3 are formed for Teff's below {\~{}}400 and {\~{}}200 K, respectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and does not include the effects of stellar insulation. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive attempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to develop a nongray theory of objects from 0.3MJ ("Saturn") to 70MJ ({\~{}}0.07 M{\&}sun;). We find that the detection ranges for brown dwarf/EGP discovery of both ground- and space-based telescopes are larger than previously estimated.},

abstract = {Understanding the formation and evolution of giant planets ({\$}\backslashge{\$}1 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}) at wide orbital separation ({\$}\backslashge{\$}5 AU) is one of the goals of direct imaging. Over the past 15 years, many surveys have placed strong constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit giants, mostly based on non-detections, but very few have tried to make a direct link with planet formation theories. In the present work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large program with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical sample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar companions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat distributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the sub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75-5.7{\%} at the 68{\%} confidence level (CL) within 20-300 AU and 0.5-75 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, which is compatible with previously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions of state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational instability (GI) formation scenario by Forgan {\&} Rice (2013), with and without scattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered populations, we would be able to detect more than 30{\%} of companions in the 1-75 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$} range (95{\%} CL). With the 3 sub-stellar detections in our sample, we estimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be within 1.0-8.6{\%} (95{\%} CL). We also conclude that even though GI is not common, it predicts a mass distribution of wide-orbit massive companions that is much closer to what is observed than what the core accretion scenario predicts. Finally, we associate the present paper with the release of the Direct Imaging Virtual Archive (DIVA, http://cesam.lam.fr/diva/), a public database that aims at gathering the results of past, present, and future direct imaging surveys.},

abstract = {[Abbreviated] We present the results of a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic follow-up survey of 182 M4-L7 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) from the BANYAN All-Sky Survey (BASS) for candidate members of nearby, young moving groups (YMGs). We confirm signs of low-gravity for 42 new BD discoveries with estimated masses between 8-75 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$} and identify previously unrecognized signs of low gravity for 24 known BDs. This allows us to refine the fraction of low-gravity dwarfs in the high-probability BASS sample to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}82{\%}. We use this unique sample of 66 young BDs, supplemented with 22 young BDs from the literature, to construct new empirical NIR absolute magnitude and color sequences for low-gravity BDs. We obtain a spectroscopic confirmation of low-gravity for 2MASS J14252798-3650229, which is a new {\$}\backslashsim{\$}27 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, L4 {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} bona fide member of AB Doradus. We identify a total of 19 new low-gravity candidate members of YMGs with estimated masses below 13 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, seven of which have kinematically estimated distances within 40 pc. These objects will be valuable benchmarks for a detailed atmospheric characterization of planetary-mass objects with the next generation of instruments. We find 16 strong candidate members of the Tucana-Horologium association with estimated masses between 12.5-14 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, a regime where our study was particularly sensitive. This would indicate that for this association there is at least one isolated object in this mass range for every {\$}17.5{\_}{\{}-5.0{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+6.6{\}}{\$} main-sequence stellar member, a number significantly higher than expected based on standard log-normal initial mass function, however in the absence of radial velocity and parallax measurements for all of them, it is likely that this over-density is caused by a number of young interlopers from other moving groups. We identify 12 new L0-L5 field BDs, seven of which display peculiar properties.},

abstract = {Circumplanetary disks can be found around forming giant planets, regardless of whether core accretion or gravitational instability built the planet. We carried out state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of the circumplanetary disks for both formation scenarios, using as similar initial conditions as possible to unveil possible intrinsic differences in the circumplanetary disk mass and temperature between the two formation mechanisms. We found that the circumplanetary disks mass linearly scales with the circumstellar disk mass. Therefore, in an equally massive protoplanetary disk, the circumplanetary disks formed in the disk instability model can be only a factor of eight more massive than their core-accretion counterparts. On the other hand, the bulk circumplanetary disk temperature differs by more than an order of magnitude between the two cases. The subdisks around planets formed by gravitational instability have a characteristic temperature below 100 K, while the core accretion circumplanetary disks are hot, with temperatures even greater than 1000 K when embedded in massive, optically thick protoplanetary disks. We explain how this difference can be understood as the natural result of the different formation mechanisms. We argue that the different temperatures should persist up to the point when a full-fledged gas giant forms via disk instability, hence our result provides a convenient criteria for observations to distinguish between the two main formation scenarios by measuring the bulk temperature in the planet vicinity.},

abstract = {With the increasing number of directly imaged giant exoplanets, the current atmosphere models are often not capable of fully explaining the spectra and luminosity of the sources. A particularly challenging component of the atmosphere models is the formation and properties of condensate cloud layers, which fundamentally impact the energetics, opacity, and evolution of the planets. Here we present a suite of techniques that can be used to estimate the level of rotational modulations these planets may show. We propose that the time-resolved observations of such periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations of extrasolar planets due to their rotation can be used as a powerful tool to probe the heterogeneity of their optical surfaces. In this paper, we develop simulations to explore the capabilities of current and next-generation ground- and space-based instruments for this technique. We address and discuss the following questions: (1) what planet properties can be deduced from the light curve and/or spectra, and in particular can we determine rotation periods, spot coverage, spot colors, and spot spectra?; (2) what is the optimal configuration of instrument/wavelength/temporal sampling required for these measurements?; and (3) can principal component analysis be used to invert the light curve and deduce the surface map of the planet? Our simulations describe the expected spectral differences between homogeneous (clear or cloudy) and patchy atmospheres, outline the significance of the dominant absorption features of H2O, CH4, and CO, and provide a method to distinguish these two types of atmospheres. Assuming surfaces with and without clouds for most currently imaged planets the current models predict the largest variations in the J band. Simulated photometry from current and future instruments is used to estimate the level of detectable photometric variations. We conclude that future instruments will be able to recover not only the rotation periods, cloud cover, cloud colors, and spectra but even cloud evolution. We also show that a longitudinal map of the planet's atmosphere can be deduced from its disk-integrated light curves.},

Measuring the tiny variations in the transmission spectrum, together with atmospheric modelling, then gives clues to the properties of the exoplanet's atmosphere. Chemical species composed of light elements{\$}-{\$}such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, sodium and potassium{\$}-{\$}have in this way been detected in the atmospheres of several hot giant exoplanets, but molecules composed of heavier elements have thus far proved elusive. Nonetheless, it has been predicted that metal oxides such as titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide occur in the observable regions of the very hottest exoplanetary atmospheres, causing thermal inversions on the dayside. Here we report the detection of TiO in the atmosphere of the hot-Jupiter planet WASP-19b. Our combined spectrum, with its wide spectral coverage, reveals the presence of TiO (to a confidence level of 7.7{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}), a strongly scattering haze (7.4{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}) and sodium (3.4{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}), and confirms the presence of water (7.9{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}) in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The intermediate-mass star Beta Pictoris is known to be surrounded by a structured edge-on debris disk within which a gas giant planet was discovered orbiting at 8-10 AU. The physical properties of Beta Pic b were previously inferred from broad and narrow-band 0.9-4.8 microns photometry. We used commissioning data of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to obtain new astrometry and a low-resolution (R=35-39) J-band (1.12-1.35 microns) spectrum of the planet. We find that the planet has passed the quadrature. We constrain its semi-major axis to {\$}\backslashleq{\$} 10 AU (90 {\%} prob.) with a peak at 8.9+0.4-0.6 AU. The joint fit of the planet astrometry and the most recent radial velocity measurements of the star yields a planet's dynamical mass {\$}\backslashleq{\$} 20 MJup (greater than 96 {\%} prob.). The extracted spectrum of Beta Pic b is similar to those of young L1-1.5+1 dwarfs. We use the spectral type estimate to revise the planet luminosity to log(L/Lsun)=-3.90+-0.07. The 0.9-4.8 microns photometry and spectrum are reproduced for Teff=1650+-150 K and a log g lower than 4.7 dex by 12 grids of PHOENIX-based and LESIA atmospheric models. If we adopt the most recent system age estimate (21+-4 Myr), the bolometric luminosity and the constraints on the dynamical mass of Beta Pic b are only reproduced by warm- and hot-start tracks with initial entropies Si greater than 10.5 kB/baryon. Such initial conditions may result from an inefficient accretion shock and/or a planetesimal density at formation higher than in the classical core accretion model. Considering a younger age for the system or a conservative formation time for Beta Pic b does not change these conclusions.},

abstract = {We have obtained radial velocities of a sample of 18 ultracool dwarfs (M6.5-T8) using high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with NIRSPEC and the Keck II telescope. We have confirmed that the radial velocity of Gl 570D is coincident with that of the K-type primary star Gl 570A, thus providing additional support for their true companionship. The presence of planetary-mass companions around 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5 V) has been analyzed using five NIRSPEC radial velocity measurements obtained over a period of 4.37 yr. We have computed UVW space motions for a total of 21 L and T dwarfs within 20 pc of the Sun. This population shows UVW velocities that nicely overlap the typical kinematics of solar to M-type stars within the same spatial volume. However, the mean Galactic and tangential velocities of the L and T dwarfs appear to be smaller than those of G to M stars. A significant fraction ({\~{}}40{\%}) of the ultracool dwarfs lie near the Hyades moving group (0.4-2 Gyr), which contrasts with the 10{\%}-12{\%} found for earlier type stellar neighbors. In addition, the distributions of the UVW components and the distributions of the total Galactic and tangential velocities derived for the L and T sample are narrower than those measured for nearby G-, K-, and M-type stars, but similar to the dispersions obtained for F stars. This suggests that, in the solar neighborhood, the population of L- and T-type ultracool dwarfs (including brown dwarfs) is kinematically younger than solar-type to early M stars, with likely ages in the interval 0.5-4 Gyr.},

abstract = {We report differential I-band and J-band photometry of SOri 45, a cool (spectral type M8.5), young (1–8 Myr) brown dwarf of the $\sigma$Orionis cluster with a likely mass estimated at around 20 times the mass of Jupiter.We detect variability (amplitudes ranging from 34 to 81mmag) and observe a modulation at a period of 2.5–3.6 h in both optical and near-infrared light curves. The most recent optical data set, however, presents a modulation at the very short period of 46.4±1.5min, which remains a mystery. The origin of the 2.5–3.6 h modulation is analyzed in terms of various scenarios: inhomogeneous features (dust clouds or magnetically induced dark spots) co-rotating with the object's surface, and presence of an unseen very low-mass companion that is steadily transferring mass to the primary. Because of the very young age of the object and its persistent strong H$\alpha$ emission, the possible presence of an accreting disk is also discussed. If the period of a few hours is related to rotation, our results suggest that $\sigma$Orionis low-mass brown dwarfs are rotating faster than more massive cluster brown dwarfs at a rate consistent with their theoretically inferred masses and radii, implying that all of these objects have undergone similar angular momentum evolution.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {We present the distance-calibrated spectral energy distribution (SED) of the sdL3.5 subdwarf SDSS J125637.13-022452.4 (J1256-0224) using its Gaia parallax and its resultant bolometric luminosity and semi-empirical fundamental parameters, as well as updated UVW velocities. The SED of J1256-0224 is compared to field-age and low-gravity dwarfs of the same effective temperature (Teff) and bolometric luminosity. In the former comparison, we find that the SED of J1256-0224 is brighter than the field source in the optical, but dims in comparison beyond the J-band, where it becomes fainter than the field from the H through W2 bands. Compared to the young source, its fainter at all wavelengths. We conclude that J1256-0224 is depleted of condensates compared to both objects. A near infrared band-by-band analysis of the spectral features of J1256-0224 is done and is compared to the equivalent Teff sample. From this analysis, we find a peculiar behavior of the J-band K I doublets whereby the 1.17 micron doublet is stronger than the field or young source as expected, while the 1.25 micron doublet shows indications of low gravity. In examining a sample of 4 other subdwarfs with comparable data we confirm this trend across different subtypes indicating that the 1.25 micron doublet is a poor indicator of gravity for low metallicity objects. In the K-band analysis of J1256-0224 we detect the 2.29 micron CO line of J1256-0224, previously unseen in the low-resolution SpeX data. We also present fundamental parameters using Gaia parallaxes for 9 additional subdwarfs with spectral types M7 - L7 for comparison. The 10 subdwarfs are placed in a temperature sequence and we find a poor linear correlation with spectral type. We present polynomial relations for absolute magnitude in JHKW1W2, effective temperature, and bolometric luminosity versus spectral type for subdwarfs.},

In this review, we explore the essential elements of the theory of brown dwarfs and giant planets, as well as of the new spectroscopic classes L and T. To this end, we describe their evolution, spectra, atmospheric compositions, chemistry, physics, and nuclear phases and explain the basic systematics of substellar-mass objects across three orders of magnitude in both mass and age and a factor of 30 in effective temperature. Moreover, we discuss the distinctive features of those extrasolar giant planets that are irradiated by a central primary, in particular their reflection spectra, albedos, and transits. Aspects of the latest theory of Jupiter and Saturn are also presented. Throughout, we highlight the effects of condensates, clouds, molecular abundances, and molecular/atomic opacities in brown dwarf and giant planet atmospheres and summarize the resulting spectral diagnostics. Where possible, the theory is put in its current observational context.},

abstract = {In June 2010, we confirmed the existence of a giant planet in the disk of the young star Beta Pictoris, located between 8 AU and 15 AU from the star. This young planet offers the rare opportunity to monitor a large fraction of the orbit using the imaging technique over a reasonably short timescale. Using the NAOS-CONICA adaptive-optics instrument (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we obtained repeated follow-up images of the Bpic system in the Ks and L' filters at four new epochs in 2010 and 2011. Complementing these data with previous measurements, we conduct a homogeneous analysis, which covers more than eight yrs, to accurately monitor the Bpic b position relative to the star. On the basis of the evolution of the planet's relative position with time, we derive the best-fit orbital solutions for our measurements. More reliable results are found with a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. The solutions favor a low-eccentricity orbit e {\textless} 0.17, with semi-major axis in the range 8--9 AU corresponding to orbital periods of 17--21 yrs. Our solutions favor a highly inclined solution with a peak around i=88.5+-1.7 deg, and a longitude of ascending node tightly constrained at Omega = -147.5+-1.5 deg. These results indicate that the orbital plane of the planet is likely to be above the midplane of the main disk, and compatible with the warp component of the disk being tilted between 3.5 deg and 4.0 deg. This suggests that the planet plays a key role in the origin of the inner warped-disk morphology of the Bpic disk. Finally, these orbital parameters are consistent with the hypothesis that the planet is responsible for the transit-like event observed in November 1981, and also linked to the cometary activity observed in the Bpic system.},

SPIRou will also efficiently tackle many key programmes beyond these two main goals, from weather patterns on brown dwarfs to Solar-System planet and exoplanet atmospheres. SPIRou will cover a wide spectral domain in a single exposure (0.98-2.44um at a resolving power of 70K, yielding unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a 15{\%} average throughput at a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m/s.

abstract = {Within the general framework of core-nucleated accretion theory of giant planet formation, the conglomeration of massive gaseous envelopes is facilitated by a transient period of rapid accumulation of nebular material. While the concurrent buildup of angular momentum is expected to leave newly formed planets spinning at near-breakup velocities, Jupiter and Saturn, as well as super-Jovian long-period extrasolar planets, are observed to rotate well below criticality. In this work, we demonstrate that the large luminosity of a young giant planet simultaneously leads to the generation of a strong planetary magnetic field, as well as thermal ionization of the circumplanetary disk. The ensuing magnetic coupling between the planetary interior and the quasi-Keplerian motion of the disk results in efficient braking of planetary rotation, with hydrodynamic circulation of gas within the Hill sphere playing the key role of expelling spin angular momentum to the circumstellar nebula. Our results place early-stage giant planet and stellar rotation within the same evolutionary framework, and motivate further exploration of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in the context of the final stages of giant planet formation.},

Among our sample stars, two have spectral type M6, three are M7, three are M8 and two are L0. Most of our targets are old low mass stars. We identify a total of 283 flares in all of the stars in our sample, with $\backslash$textit{\{}Kepler{\}} energies in the range log $\backslash$textit{\{}E{\$}{\_}{\{}Kp{\}}{\$}{\}} {\$}\backslashsim{\$}(29 - 33.5) erg. Using the maximum-likelihood method of line fitting, we find that the flare frequency distribution (FFD) for each star in our sample follows a power law with slope -{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} in range -(1.3-2.0). We find that cooler objects tend to have shallower slopes. For some of our targets, the FFD follows either a broken power law, or a power law with an exponential cutoff.

In case of 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we report a flare brightening by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}144 relative to the quiescent photospheric level.

abstract = {Auroras are (generally) high-latitude atmospheric emissions that result from the precipitation of energetic charged particles from a planet's magnetosphere. Auroral emissions from the giant planets have been observed from ground-based observatories, Earth-orbiting satellites (e.g., International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and R{\"{o}}entgensatellit (ROSAT)), flyby spacecraft (e.g., Voyager 1 and 2), and orbiting spacecraft platforms (e.g., Galileo) at X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), visible, infrared (IR), and radio wavelengths. UV, visible, and IR auroras are atmospheric emissions, produced or initiated when ambient atmospheric species are excited through collisions with the precipitating particles, while radio and X-ray auroras are beam emissions, produced by the precipitating species themselves. The emissions at different wavelengths provide unique and complementary information, accessible to remote sensing, about the key physical processes operating in the atmospheric and magnetospheric regions where they originate. This paper reviews the development of our current understanding of auroral emissions from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, as revealed through multispectral observations and supplemented by plasma measurements.},

Here we report the results of an independent analysis of archival data from the Brown dwarf Atmosphere Monitoring (BAM) program. Time series data for 14 L and T dwarfs reported to be significantly variable over timescales of hours were analyzed. We confirm large-amplitude variability (amplitudes {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}2$\backslash${\%}) for 4/13 targets and place upper limits of 0.7$\backslash${\%}-1.6$\backslash${\%} on variability in the remaining sample. For two targets we find evidence of weak variability at amplitudes of 1.3$\backslash${\%} and 1.6$\backslash${\%}. Based on our revised classification of variable objects in the BAM study, we find strong variability outside the L/T transition to be rare at near infrared wavelengths. From a combined sample of 81 L0-T9 dwarfs from the revised BAM sample and the variability survey of Radigan et al. we infer an overall observed frequency for large-amplitude variability outside the L/T transition of 3.2{\$}{\_}{\{}-1.8{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+2.8{\}}{\$}$\backslash${\%}, in contrast to 24{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+11{\}}{\_}{\{}-9{\}}{\$}$\backslash${\%} for L9-T3.5 spectral types.

abstract = {We present previously unpublished July 2005 {\$}H{\$}-band coronagraphic data of the young, planet-hosting star HR 8799 from the newly-released Keck/NIRC2 archive. Despite poor observing conditions, we detect three of the planetary companions (HR 8799 bcd), two of them (HR 8799 bc) without advanced image processing. Comparing these data with previously published 1998-2011 astrometry and that from re-reduced October 2010 Keck data constrains the orbits of the planets. Analyzing the planets' astrometry separately, HR 8799 d's orbit is likely inclined at least 25{\$}{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$} from face-on and the others may be on in inclined orbits. For semimajor axis ratios consistent with a 4:2:1 mean-motion resonance, our analysis yields precise values for HR 8799 bcd's orbital parameters and strictly constrains the planets' eccentricities to be less than 0.18--0.3. However, we find no acceptable orbital solutions with this resonance that place the planets in face-on orbits; HR 8799 d shows the largest deviation from such orbits. Moreover, few orbits make HR 8799 d coplanar with b and c, whereas dynamical stability analyses used to constrain the planets' masses typically assume coplanar and/or face-on orbits. This paper illustrates the significant science gain enabled with the release of the NIRC2 archive.},

Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

These eclipse depths reveal that the shape of the inferred emission spectrum for the planet differs significantly from the predictions of standard atmosphere models; instead the most plausible explanation would require the presence of an inversion layer high in the atmosphere leading to significant water emission in the 4.5 and 5.8 micron bandpasses. This is the first clear indication of such a temperature inversion in the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter, as previous observations of other planets appeared to be in reasonably good agreement with the predictions of models without such an inversion layer.},

Self-consistent photodynamical modeling suggests that the planet is likely several Jupiter masses, while the exomoon has a mass and radius similar to Neptune.

abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy provides a window to study exoplanetary atmospheres, but that window is fogged by clouds and hazes. Clouds and haze introduce a degeneracy between the strength of gaseous absorption features and planetary physical parameters such as abundances. One way to break that degeneracy is via statistical studies. We collect all published HST/WFC3 transit spectra for 1.1-1.65 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m water vapor absorption, and perform a statistical study on potential correlations between the water absorption feature and planetary parameters. We fit the observed spectra with a template calculated for each planet using the Exo-Transmit code. We express the magnitude of the water absorption in scale heights, thereby removing the known dependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean molecular weight. We find that the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation with planetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud condensation with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline slope. However, the observed sample is also intrinsically degenerate in the sense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary mass. We compile the distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this distribution is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that the distribution of equilibrium temperatures for the observed planets is similarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption values are affected by observational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient sample of the hottest planets.},

abstract = {As brown dwarfs and young giant planets cool down, they are known to experience various chemical transitions --- for example from CO rich L-dwarfs to methane rich T-dwarfs. Those chemical transitions are accompanied by spectral transitions whose sharpness cannot be explained by chemistry alone. In a series of articles, Tremblin et al. proposed that some of the yet unexplained features associated to these transitions could be explained by a reduction of the thermal gradient near the photosphere. To explain, in turn, this more isothermal profile, they invoke the presence of an instability analogous to fingering convection -- compositional convection -- triggered by the change in mean molecular weight of the gas due to the chemical transitions mentioned above. In this short note, we use existing arguments to demonstrate that any turbulent transport, if present, would in fact increase the thermal gradient. This misinterpretation comes from the fact that turbulence mixes/homogenizes entropy (potential temperature) instead of temperature. So, while increasing transport, turbulence in an initially stratified atmosphere actually carries energy downward, whether it is due to fingering or any other type of compositional convection. These processes therefore cannot explain the features observed along the aforementioned transitions by reducing the thermal gradient in the atmosphere of substellar objects. Understanding the microphysical and dynamical properties of clouds at these transitions thus probably remains our best way forward.},

Separated by 11.9" (487 AU in projection) from its host star, HD 203030B has an estimated mass of 0.023 (+0.008;-0.011) solar masses. The K-band spectral type of L7.5+/-0.5 places HD 203030B near the critical L/T transition in brown dwarfs, which is characterized by the rapid disappearance of dust in sub-stellar photospheres. From a comparative analysis with well-characterized field L/T transition dwarfs, we find that, despite its young age, HD 203030B has a bolometric luminosity similar to the {\textgreater}1 Gyr-old field dwarfs. Adopting a radius from current models of sub-stellar evolution, we hence obtain that the effective temperature of HD 203030B is only 1206 (+74;-116) K, markedly lower than the {\~{}}1440 K effective temperatures of field L/T transition dwarfs. The temperature discrepancy can be resolved if either: (1) the ages of field brown dwarfs have been over-estimated by a factor of $\backslash${\~{}}1.5, leading to under-estimated radii, or (2) the lower effective temperature of HD 203030B is related to its young age, implying that the effective temperature at the L/T transition is gravity-dependent.},

At this stage we are uncomfortable assigning a final, unambiguous age to the Argus association as our membership list for the association appears to suffer from a high level of contamination, and therefore it remains unclear whether these stars represent a single population of coeval stars. Our isochronal ages for both the BPMG and Tuc-Hor are consistent with recent lithium depletion boundary (LDB) ages, which unlike isochronal ages, are relatively insensitive to the choice of low-mass evolutionary models.

abstract = {We have discovered that SDSSJ105213.51+442255.7 (T0.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.0) is a binary in Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, displaying a large J-to-K-band flux reversal ({\$}\backslashDelta{\$}J = -0.45{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.09 mag, {\$}\backslashDelta{\$}K = 0.52{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.05 mag). We determine a total dynamical mass from Keck orbital monitoring (88{\$}\backslashpm{\$}5 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}) and a mass ratio by measuring the photocenter orbit from CFHT/WIRCam absolute astrometry ({\$}M{\_}B/M{\_}A{\$} = 0.78{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.07). Combining these provides the first individual dynamical masses for any field L or T dwarfs, 49{\$}\backslashpm{\$}3 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} for the L6.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.5 primary and 39{\$}\backslashpm{\$}3 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} for the T1.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.0 secondary. Such a low mass ratio for a nearly equal luminosity binary implies a shallow mass{\$}-{\$}luminosity relation over the L/T transition ({\$}\backslashDelta{\$}log{\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm bol{\}}{\$}/{\$}\backslashDelta{\$}log{\$}M = 0.6{\^{}}{\{}+0.6{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.8{\}}{\$}). This provides the first observational support that cloud dispersal plays a significant role in the luminosity evolution of substellar objects. Fully cloudy models fail our coevality test for this binary, giving ages for the two components that disagree by 0.2 dex (2.0{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}). In contrast, our observed masses and luminosities can be reproduced at a single age by "hybrid" evolutionary tracks where a smooth change from a cloudy to cloudless photosphere around 1300 K causes slowing of luminosity evolution. Remarkably, such models also match our observed JHK flux ratios and colors well. Overall, it seems that the distinguishing features SDSSJ1052+4422AB, like a J-band flux reversal and high-amplitude variability, are normal for a field L/T binary caught during the process of cloud dispersal, given that the age (1.11{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+0.17{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.20{\}}{\$} Gyr) and surface gravity (log{\$}g{\$} = 5.0{\$}-{\$}5.2) of SDSSJ1052+4422AB are typical for field ultracool dwarfs.},

abstract = {We have observed 6 late-L and T dwarfs with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to investigate the presence of highly circularly polarized radio emission, associated with large-scale auroral currents. Previous surveys encompassing {\~{}}60 L6 or later targets in this spectral range have yielded only one detection. Our sample includes the previously detected T6.5 dwarf 2MASS 10475385+2124234 as well as 5 new targets selected for the presence of H-alpha emission or optical/infrared photometric variability, which are possible manifestations of auroral activity. We detect 2MASS 10475385+2124234, as well as 4 of the 5 targets in our biased sample, including the strong IR variable SIMP J01365662+0933473 and bright H-alpha emitter 2MASS 12373919+6526148, reinforcing the possibility that activity at these disparate wavelengths is related. The radio emission frequency corresponds to a precise determination of the lower-bound magnetic field strength near the surface of each dwarf and this new sample provides robust constraints on dynamo theory in the low mass brown dwarf regime. Magnetic fields {\textgreater}2.5 kG are confirmed for 5/6 targets. Our results provide tentative evidence that the dynamo operating in this mass regime may be inconsistent with predicted values from a recently proposed model. Further observations at higher radio frequencies are essential for verifying this assertion.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present a large, uniform analysis of young ({\~{}}10-150 Myr) ultracool dwarfs, based on new high-precision IR parallaxes for 68 objects. We find that low-gravity (VL-G) late-M and L dwarfs form a continuous sequence in IR color-magnitude diagrams, separate from field objects and current theoretical models. VL-G objects also appear distinct from young substellar (brown dwarf and exoplanet) companions, suggesting the two populations have a different range of physical properties. In contrast, at the L/T transition, young, old, and peculiar objects all span a narrow range in near-IR absolute magnitudes. At a given spectral type, the IR absolute magnitudes of young objects can be offset from ordinary field dwarfs, with the largest offsets occurring in the Y and J bands for late-M dwarfs (brighter than the field) and mid/late-L dwarfs (fainter than the field). Overall, low-gravity (VL-G) objects have the most uniform photometric behavior while intermediate-gravity (INT-G) objects are more diverse, suggesting a third governing parameter beyond spectral type and gravity class. We examine the moving group memberships for all young ultracool dwarfs with parallaxes, changing/refuting the status of 23 objects and fortifying the status of another 28 objects. We use our resulting age-calibrated sample to establish empirical young isochrones and find a declining frequency of VL-G objects relative to INT-G objects with increasing age. Notable objects in our sample include high-velocity INT-G objects; very red, late-L dwarfs with high surface gravities; candidate disk-bearing members of the MBM20 cloud and beta Pic moving group; and very young distant interlopers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive summary of the absolute magnitudes and spectral classifications of 102 young ultracool dwarfs, found in the field and as substellar companions to young stars.},

abstract = {L dwarfs exhibit low-level, rotationally-modulated photometric variability generally associated with heterogeneous, cloud-covered atmospheres. The spectral character of these variations yields insight into the particle sizes and vertical structure of the clouds. Here we present the results of a high precision, ground-based, near-infrared, spectral monitoring study of two mid-type L dwarfs that have variability reported in the literature, 2MASS J08354256-0819237 and 2MASS J18212815+1414010, using the SpeX instrument on the Infrared Telescope Facility. By simultaneously observing a nearby reference star, we achieve {\textless}0.15{\%} per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes across the 0.9--2.4um bandwidth. We find that 2MASS J0835-0819 exhibits marginal ({\textless} {\~{}}0.5{\%} per band) variability with no clear spectral dependence, while 2MASS J1821+1414 varies by up to +/-1.5{\%} at 0.9 um, with the variability amplitude declining toward longer wavelengths. The latter result extends the variability trend observed in prior HST/WFC3 spectral monitoring of 2MASS J1821+1414, and we show that the full 0.9-2.4 um variability amplitude spectrum can be reproduced by Mie extinction from dust particles with a log-normal particle size distribution with a median radius of 0.24 um. We do not detect statistically significant phase variations with wavelength. The different variability behavior of 2MASS J0835-0819 and 2MASS J1821+1414 suggests dependencies on viewing angle and/or overall cloud content, underlying factors that can be examined through a broader survey.},

The main goal is to address their cluster membership via photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic studies, and to determine the properties of the least massive population of the cluster through the comparison of the data with younger and older spectral counterparts and state-of-the art model atmospheres. We confirm three bona-fide Pleiades members that have extremely red optical and infrared colors, effective temperatures of {\~{}}1150 K and {\~{}}1350 K, and masses in the interval 11-20 Mjup, and one additional likely member that shares the same motion as the cluster but does not appear to be as red as the other members with similar brightness. This latter object requires further near-infrared spectroscopy to fully address its membership in the Pleiades. The optical spectra of two bona-fide members were classified as L6-L7 and show features of KI, a tentative detection of CsI, hydrides and water vapor with an intensity similar to high-gravity dwarfs of related classification despite their young age. The properties of the Pleiades L6-L7 members clearly indicate that very red colors of L dwarfs are not a direct evidence of ages younger than {\~{}}100 Myr. We also report on the determination of the bolometric corrections for the coolest Pleiades members. These data can be used to interpret the observations of the atmospheres of exoplanets orbiting stars.},

A continuous 45-minute sequence of low-resolution IRTF/SpeX data spanning 0.8-2.4 micron were obtained, concurrent with combined-light optical photometry with ESO/TRAPPIST. Our spectral observations confirm the flux reversal of this binary, and we detect a wavelength-dependent decline in the relative spectral fluxes of the two components coincident with a decline in the combined-light optical brightness of the system over the course of the observation. These data are successfully modeled as a combination of brightness and color variability in the T0.5 Luhman 16B, consistent cloud variations; and no significant variability in L7.5 Luhman 16A. We estimate a peak-to-peak amplitude of 13.5{\%} at 1.25 micron over the full lightcurve. Using a two-spot brightness temperature model, we infer an average cloud covering fraction of {\~{}}30-55{\%} for Luhman 16B, varying by 15-30{\%} over a rotation period. A Rhines scale interpretation for the size of the variable features explains an apparent correlation between period and amplitude for three highly variable T dwarfs, and predicts relatively fast winds (1-3 km/s) for Luhman 16B consistent with lightcurve evolution on an advective time scale (1-3 rotation periods). Our observations support the model of a patchy disruption of the mineral cloud layer as a universal feature of the L dwarf/T dwarf transition.},

abstract = {We conducted a Doppler survey at Keck combined with NIRC2 K-band AO imaging to search for massive, long-period companions to 123 known exoplanet systems with one or two planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter mass planets out to 20 AU for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends indicating the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 AU. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 +/- 5{\%} over the range 1 - 20 M{\_}Jup and 5 - 20 AU. Our data also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 AU, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 AU. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3-10 AU, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall gas giant planet population. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

abstract = {The system of four planets around HR8799 offers a unique opportunity to probe the physics and chemistry at play in the atmospheres of self-luminous young ({\~{}}30 Myr) planets. We recently obtained new photometry of the four planets and low-resolution (R{\~{}}30) spectra of HR8799 d and e with the SPHERE instrument (paper III). In this paper (paper IV), we compare the available spectra and photometry of the planets to known objects and atmospheric models (BT-SETTL14, Cloud-AE60, Exo-REM) to characterize the atmospheric properties of the planets. We find that HR8799d and e properties are well reproduced by those of L6-L8 dusty dwarfs discovered in the field, among which some are candidate members of young nearby associations. No known object reproduces well the properties of planets b and c. Nevertheless, we find that the spectra and WISE photometry of peculiar and/or young early-T dwarfs reddened by submicron grains made of corundum, iron, enstatite, or forsterite successfully reproduce the SED of these two planets. Our analysis confirms that only the Exo-REM models with thick clouds fit (within 2{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}) the whole set of spectrophotometric datapoints available for HR8799 d and e for Teff = 1200 K, log g in the range 3.0-4.5, and M/H=+0.5. The models still fail to reproduce the SED of HR8799c and b. The determination of the metallicity, log g, and cloud thickness are degenerate. We conclude that an enhanced content in dust and decreased CIA of H2 is certainly responsible for the deviation of the properties of the planet with respect to field dwarfs. The analysis suggests in addition that HR8799c and b have later spectral types than the two other planets, and therefore could both have lower masses.},

An aperature spanning 180 degrees in longitude was scanned over a mosaic and the total brightness in the aperature was computed as a function of the aperature's central longitude. The 4.78 micron (thermal emission) scan showed peak-to-trough variations of 0.2 magnitudes, whereas the 0.410 micron (reflected sunlight) scan showed variations of only 0.04 magnitudes. Periodogram analysis of the simulated observations found variability periods of 9.92 hours, within 5{\%} of the input value. These results suggest that looking for variability in cool brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets should be performed at thermal infrared wavelengths, where clouds in the object's atmosphere make the surface appear patchy.},

abstract = {The spin-rotation of a planet arises from the accretion of angular momentum during its formation, but the details of this process are still unclear. In the solar system, the equatorial rotation velocities and spin angular momentum of the planets show a clear trend with mass, except for Mercury and Venus which have significantly spun down since their formation due to tidal interactions. Here we report on near-infrared spectroscopic observations at R=100,000 of the young extra-solar gas giant beta Pictoris b. The absorption signal from carbon monoxide in the planet's thermal spectrum is found to be blueshifted with respect to the velocity of the parent star by (-15+-1.7) km/sec, consistent with a circular orbit. The combined line profile exhibits a rotational broadening of 25+-3 km/sec, meaning that Beta Pictoris b spins significantly faster than any planet in the solar system, in line with the extrapolation of the known trend in spin velocity with planet mass.},

abstract = {Clouds of metal-bearing condensates play a critical role in shaping the emergent spectral energy distributions of the coolest classes of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, L and T dwarfs. Because condensate clouds in planetary atmospheres show distinct horizontal structure, we have explored a model for partly cloudy atmospheres in brown dwarfs. Our model successfully reproduces the colors and magnitudes of both L and T dwarfs for the first time, including the unexpected brightning of the early- and mid-type T dwarfs at J-band, provided that clouds are rapidly removed from the photosphere at T{\_}eff {\~{}} 1200 K. The clearing of cloud layers also explains the surprising persistence and strengthening of gaseous FeH bands in early- and mid-type T dwarfs. The breakup of cloud layers is likely driven by convection in the troposphere, analogous to phenomena observed on Jupiter. Our results demonstrate that planetary-like atmospheric dynamics must be considered when examining the evolution of free-floating brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {Aims: We determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and projected rotational velocity of nine T dwarfs from the comparison of high-resolution near-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate the mass and age of the objects from state-of-the-art models.   Methods: We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar metallicity models provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of nine T-type field dwarfs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph NIRSPEC using ten echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.147 to 1.347 $\mu$m with a resolving power R˜20 000. The projected rotational velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity of the objects are determined based on the minimum root mean square of the differences between the modelled and observed relative fluxes. Estimates of the mass and age of the objects are obtained from effective temperature-surface gravity diagrams, where our results are compared with existing solar metallicity models.  Results: The modelled spectra reproduce quite well the observed features for most of the T dwarfs, with effective temperatures in the range of 922-1009 K, and surface gravities between 104.1 and 104.9 cm s-2. Our results support the assumption of a dust free atmosphere for T dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and then gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra do not accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the K i doublet at 1.2436 and 1.2525 $\mu$m. Our modelled spectra does not match well the observed spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely SDSSp J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is likely due to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in the models used here. By comparing our results and their uncertainties to evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval ≈5-75{\~{}}MJ for T dwarfs later than T5, which are in good agreement with those found in the literature. We found apparent young ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for the same T dwarfs, which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.  Reduced NIRSPEC spectra of the nine T-type dwarfs are available electronically in fits format at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/501/1059},

abstract = {We have monitored photometrically the Y0 brown dwarf WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (W1738) at both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. This {\~{}}1 Gyr-old 400K dwarf is at a distance of 8pc and has a mass around 5 M{\_}Jupiter. We observed W1738 using two near-infrared filters at lambda{\~{}}1um, Y and J, on Gemini observatory, and two mid-infrared filters at lambda{\~{}}4um, [3.6] and [4.5], on the Spitzer observatory. Twenty-four hours were spent on the source by Spitzer on each of June 30 and October 30 2013 UT. Between these observations, around 5 hours were spent on the source by Gemini on each of July 17 and August 23 2013 UT. The mid-infrared light curves show significant evolution between the two observations separated by four months. We find that a double sinusoid can be fit to the [4.5] data, where one sinusoid has a period of 6.0 +/- 0.1 hours and the other a period of 3.0 +/- 0.1 hours. The near-infrared observations suggest variability with a {\~{}}3.0 hour period, although only at a {\textless}{\~{}}2 sigma confidence level. We interpret our results as showing that the Y dwarf has a 6.0 +/- 0.1 hour rotation period, with one or more large-scale surface features being the source of variability. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the light curve at [4.5] is 3{\%}. The amplitude of the near-infrared variability, if real, may be as high as 5 to 30{\%}. Intriguingly, this size of variability and the wavelength dependence can be reproduced by atmospheric models that include patchy KCl and Na{\_}2S clouds and associated small changes in surface temperature. The small number of large features, and the timescale for evolution of the features, is very similar to what is seen in the atmospheres of the solar system gas giants.},

It examines the effects that noise, finite spectral resolution, and uncertain stellar parameters are likely to have on real data sets, and demonstrates through a variety of test cases that the technique is efficient and accurate at recovering test images from realistic synthetic spectral data. At the high signal-to-noise ratio and resolution typical of real stellar spectra, the images are well constrained by the data set alone, rather than by entropy criteria.

Our efficient photometric+kinematic selection process identified 104 low-mass candidates which we observed with ground-based spectroscopy. We collected infrared observations of the latest spectral types ({\textgreater}M5) to search for low gravity objects. These and all {\textless}M5 candidates were observed with high-resolution optical spectrographs to measure the radial velocities and youth indicators, such as lithium absorption and H-alpha emission, needed to confirm BPMG membership, achieving a 63{\%} confirmation rate. We also compiled the most complete census of the BPMG membership with which we tested the efficiency and false-membership assignments using our selection and confirmation criteria. We assess a group age of 22 +/- 6 Myr using the new census, consistent with past estimates. With the now densely sampled lithium depletion boundary, we resolve the broadening of the boundary by either an age spread or astrophysical influences on lithium burning rates. We find that 69{\%} of the now known members with AFGKM primaries are M stars, nearing the expected value of 75{\%}. However, the new IMF for the BPMG shows a deficit of 0.2-0.3 Msun stars by a factor of approximately 2. We expect that the AFGK census of the BPMG is also incomplete, probably due to biases of searches towards the nearest stars.},

abstract = {The properties of 2M1207b, a young ({\~{}} 8 Myr) planet-mass companion, have lacked a satisfactory explanation for some time. The combination of low luminosity, red near-IR colors, and L-type near-IR spectrum (previously consistent with Teff {\~{}} 1600K) implies an abnormally small radius. Early explanations for the apparent underluminosity of 2M1207b invoked an edge-on disk or the remnant of a recent protoplanetary collision. The discovery of a second planet-mass object (HR8799b) with similar luminosity and colors as 2M1207b indicates that a third explanation, one of a purely atmospheric nature, is more likely. By including clouds, non-equilibrium chemistry, and low-gravity, an atmosphere with effective temperature consistent with evolution cooling-track predictions is revealed. Consequently, 2M1207b, and others like it, requires no new physics to explain nor do they belong to a new class of objects. Instead they most likely represent the natural extension of cloudy substellar atmospheres down to low Teff and log(g). If this atmosphere only explanation for 2M1207b is correct, then very young planet-mass objects with near-IR spectra similar to field T dwarfs may be rare.},

abstract = {Context. Observationally, spectra of brown dwarfs indicate the presence of dust in their atmospheres while theoretically it is not clear what prevents the dust from settling and disappearing from the regions of spectrum formation. Consequently, standard models have to rely on ad hoc assumptions about the mechanism that keeps dust grains aloft in the atmosphere. Aims: We apply hydrodynamical simulations to develop an improved physical understanding of the mixing properties of macroscopic flows in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres, in particular of the influence of the underlying convection zone. Methods: We performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations including a description of dust grain formation and transport with the CO5BOLD code. The simulations cover the very top of the convection zone and the photosphere including the dust layers for a sequence of effective temperatures between 900 K and 2800 K, all with log g = 5 assuming solar chemical composition. Results: Convective overshoot occurs in the form of exponentially declining velocities with small scale heights, so that it affects only the region immediately above the almost adiabatic convective layers. From there on, mixing is provided by gravity waves that are strong enough to maintain thin dust clouds in the hotter models. With decreasing effective temperature, the amplitudes of the waves become smaller but the clouds become thicker and develop internal convective flows that are more efficient in transporting and mixing material than gravity waves. The presence of clouds often leads to a highly structured appearance of the stellar surface on short temporal and small spatial scales (presently inaccessible to observations). Conclusions: We identify convectively excited gravity waves as an essential mixing process in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres. Under conditions of strong cloud formation, dust convection is the dominant self-sustaining mixing component.},

abstract = {We present medium resolution optical and NIR spectral data for components of the newly discovered WISE J104915.57-531906.1AB (Luhman 16AB) brown dwarf binary. The optical spectra reveal strong 6708 A Li I absorption in both Luhman 16A (8.0+/-0.4 A) and Luhman 16B (3.8+/-0.4 A). Interestingly, this is the first detection of Li I absorption in a T dwarf. Combined with the lack of surface gravity features, the Li I detection constrains the system age to 0.1 - 3 Gyr. In the NIR data, we find strong KI absorption at 1.168, 1.177, 1.243, and 1.254 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m in both components. Compared to the strength of KI line absorption in equivalent spectral subtype brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A is weaker while Luhman 16B is stronger. Analyzing the spectral region around each doublet in distance scaled flux units and comparing the two sources, we confirm the J band flux reversal and find that Luhman 16B has a brighter continuum in the 1.17 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m and 1.25 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m regions than Luhman 16A. Converting flux units to a brightness temperature we interpret this to mean that the secondary is {\~{}} 50 K warmer than the primary in regions dominated by condensate grain scattering. One plausible explanation for this difference is that Luhman 16B has thinner clouds or patchy holes in its atmosphere allowing us to see to deeper, hotter regions. We also detect comparably strong FeH in the 0.9896 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m Wing-Ford band for both components. Traditionally, a signpost of changing atmosphere conditions from late-type L to early T dwarfs, the persistence and similarity of FeH at 0.9896 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m in both Luhman 16A and Luhman 16B is an indication of homogenous atmosphere conditions. We calculate bolometric luminosities from observed data supplemented with best fit models for longer wavelengths and find the components are consistent within 1{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} with resultant Teffs of 1310+/-30 K and 1280+/-75 K for Luhman 16AB respectively.},

Even with a null detection result, our 1 sigma upper limit for very low mass binary frequency is 18{\%}. Our targets included 7 known, wide brown dwarf binary systems. No significant radial velocity variability was measured in our multi-epoch observations of these systems, even for those pairs for which our data spanned a significant fraction of the orbital period. Specialized techniques are required to reach the high precisions sensitive to motion in orbits of very low-mass systems.

Investigating the near-infrared color magnitude diagram for brown dwarfs confirms that 2M0355 is redder and underluminous compared to the known brown dwarf population, similar to the peculiarities of directly imaged exoplanets 2M1207b and HR8799bcd. We calculate UVW space velocities and find that the motion of 2M0355 is consistent with young disk objects ({\textless} 2-3 Gyr) and it shows a high likelihood of membership in the AB Doradus association.},

abstract = {We present the results of the Gemini Deep Planet Survey, a near-infrared adaptive optics search for giant planets and brown dwarfs around 85 nearby young stars. The observations were obtained with the Altair adaptive optics system at the Gemini North telescope, and angular differential imaging was used to suppress the speckle noise of the central star. Typically, the observations are sensitive to angular separations beyond 0.5" with 5 sigma contrast sensitivities in magnitude difference at 1.6 mum of 9.5 at 0.5", 12.9 at 1", 15.0 at 2", and 16.5 at 5". These sensitivities are sufficient to detect planets more massive than 2 MJ with a projected separation in the range 40-200 AU around a typical target. Second-epoch observations of 48 stars with candidates (out of 54) have confirmed that all candidates are unrelated background stars. A detailed statistical analysis of the survey results is presented. Assuming a planet mass distribution dn/dm{\~{}}m-1.2 and a semimajor-axis distribution dn/da{\~{}}a-1, the 95{\%} credible upper limits on the fraction of stars with at least one planet of mass 0.5-13 MJ are 0.28 for the range 10-25 AU, 0.13 for 25-50 AU, and 0.093 for 50-250 AU; this result is weakly dependent on the semimajor-axis distribution power-law index. The 95{\%} credible interval for the fraction of stars with at least one brown dwarf companion having a semimajor axis in the range 25-250 AU is 0.019+0.083-0.015, irrespective of any assumption on the mass and semimajor-axis distributions.

abstract = {HAT-P-20b is a giant metal-rich exoplanet orbiting a metal-rich star. We analyze two secondary eclipses of the planet in each of the 3.6 and 4.5 mum bands of Warm Spitzer. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically different method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect very effectively, but without explicitly using---or even measuring---the fluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and validate PLD using synthetic and real data and comparing the results to previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be intractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 ± 29 K, indicating inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5 mum band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by Spitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopy. All four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with extant RV data yields ecos omega =0.01352-0.00057+0.00054 and establishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence. HAT-P-20b is another excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other three-body mechanisms.},

abstract = {We review the current state of our knowledge concerning the rotation and angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects and brown dwarfs from a primarily observational view point. Periods are typically accurate to 1{\%} and available for about 1700 stars and 30 brown dwarfs in young clusters. Discussion of angular momentum evolution also requires knowledge of stellar radii, which are poorly known for pre-main sequence stars. It is clear that rotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher mass stars (0.4-1.2 M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) have longer periods than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs. On the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of mass for low mass pre-main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of about a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of rotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 Myr is discussed. A broad, bimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 Myr) for stars more massive than 0.4 M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The rapid rotators (50-60{\%} of the sample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss. The slow rotators continue to lose substantial amounts of angular momentum for up to 5 Myr, creating the even broader bimodal distribution characteristic of 30-120 Myr old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more prevalent among slowly rotating PMS stars, indicating a connection between accretion and rotation. Disks appear to influence rotation for, at most, {\$}\backslashsim{\$}5 Myr, and considerably less than that for the majority of stars. If the dense clusters studied so far are an accurate guide, then the typical solar-like star may have only {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 Myr for this task. It appears that both disk interactions and stellar winds are less efficient at braking these objects.},

We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

abstract = {Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1 to 1.7 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.},

We have classified our targets by visual comparison with high- and low-gravity standards and by measuring newly defined spectroscopic indices. We derived L0-L4.5 and M9-L2.5 using high- and low-gravity standards, respectively. Our targets reveal clear signposts of youth, thus corroborating their cluster membership and planetary masses (6-13 Mjup). These observations complete the sigma Orionis mass function by spectroscopically confirming the planetary-mass domain to a confidence level of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}75 percent. The comparison of our spectra with BT-Settl solar metallicity model atmospheres yields a temperature scale of 2350-1800 K and a low surface gravity of log g {\~{}} 4.0 [cm/s2], as would be expected for young planetary-mass objects. We discuss the properties of the cluster least-massive population as a function of spectral type. We have also obtained the first optical spectrum of S Ori 70, a T dwarf in the direction of sigma Orionis. Our data provide reference optical and near-infrared spectra of very young L dwarfs and a mass function that may be used as templates for future studies of low-mass substellar objects and exoplanets. The extrapolation of the sigma Orionis mass function to the solar neighborhood may indicate that isolated planetary-mass objects with temperatures of 200-300 K and masses in the interval 6-13-Mjup may be as numerous as very low-mass stars.},

@article{Vidal-Madjar1998,
abstract = {$\beta$ Pictoris is a bright southern hemisphere star observed in 1983 by the IRAS satellite as presenting a large and unexpected IR excess. This excess was called the Vega-like phenomenon and quickly identified as due to circumstellar dust. Subsequently in 1984, using stellar coronography, dust was also directly seen as an edge-on disk extended to several hundreds of AUs. Since then, $\beta$ Pictoris has been continuously observed. We present here a review of our present understanding of the $\beta$ Pictoris circumstellar environment which still appears unique in the solar neighborhood. The circumstellar dust disk is predominantly made of relatively large particles (one micron or more) extending outward to more than 1000 AU and presenting a clearer (dust free) central region away to about 35 AU from the star. The gas is detected through stable and variable spectroscopic signatures revealing a permanent gas disk with sporadic inflows and also a few outflows. These are partially interpreted in terms of evaporation of kilometer-sized bodies very close to the star. Evaporation or destruction through collisions of kilometer-sized bodies seems to be needed also to explain both the dust as well as the very presence of the CO molecule detected in the circumstellar gas. Several indirect arguments along with the observation of a very peculiar photometric variation of the star suggests that even giant planets may have already formed in the $\beta$ Pictoris system.},

The subtler statistical properties of this population are beginning to emerge with ever-increasing sample sizes: there is tentative evidence that planets on wide orbits are more frequent around stars that possess debris disks; brown dwarf companions exist at comparable (or perhaps slightly higher) rates as their counterparts in the planetary-mass regime; and the substellar companion mass function appears to be smooth and may extend down to the opacity limit for fragmentation. Within a few years, the conclusion of second-generation direct imaging surveys will enable more definitive interpretations with the ultimate goal of identifying the dominant origin of this population and uncovering its relationship to planets at smaller separations.},

Here, we present the first model capable of predicting radio emission through the electron cyclotron maser instability using observed stellar magnetic maps of low-mass stars. We determine the structure of the coronal magnetic field and plasma using spectropolarimetric observations of the surface magnetic fields and the X-ray emission measure. We then model the emission of photons from the locations within the corona that satisfy the conditions for electron cyclotron maser emission. Our model predicts the frequency, and intensity of radio photons from within the stellar corona. We have benchmarked our model against the low-mass star V374 Peg. This star has both radio observations from the Very Large Array and a nearly simultaneous magnetic map. Using our model we are able to fit the radio observations of V374 Peg, providing additional evidence that the radio emission observed from low-mass stars may originate from the electron cyclotron maser instability. Our model can now be extended to all stars with observed magnetic maps to predict the expected frequency and variability of stellar radio emission in an effort to understand and guide future radio observations of low-mass stars.},

abstract = {Context. L-type ultra-cool dwarfs and brown dwarfs have cloudy atmospheres that could host weather-like phenomena. The detection of photometric or spectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmospheric heterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck. Indeed, a number of ultra-cool dwarfs have been reported to vary. Additional time-resolved spectral observations of brown dwarfs offer the opportunity for further constraining and characterising atmospheric variability. Aims. It has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global cloud deck may account for the L-to T-type transition when brown dwarf photospheres evolve from cloudy to clear conditions. Such a mechanism is compatible with variability. We searched for variability in the spectra of five L6 to T6 brown dwarfs to test this hypothesis. Methods. We obtained spectroscopic time series using the near-infrared spectrographs ISAAC on VLT-ANTU, over 0.99-1.13 mu m, and SpeX on the Infrared Telescope Facility for two of our targets in the J, H, and K bands. We searched for statistically variable lines and for a correlation between those. Results. High spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects, but these detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. We find no evidence of large-amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we place firm upper limits of 2 to 3{\%} on broad-band variability, depending on the targets and wavelengths, on the time scale of a few hours. In contrast to the rest of the sample, the T2 transition brown dwarf SDSS J1254-0122 shows numerous variable features, but a secure variability diagnosis would require further observations. Conclusions. Assuming that any variability arises from the rotation of patterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we find that the typical physical scale of cloud-cover disruption should be smaller than 5-8{\%} of the disk area for four of our targets, using simplistic heterogeneous atmospheric models. The possible variations seen in SDSS J1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the cloud-breaking hypothesis.},

We analyze K I EWs of 73 objects of known ages and find a linear trend between log(Age) and EW. From this relationship, we assign age ranges to the very low gravity, intermediate gravity, and field gravity designations for spectral types M6-L0. Interestingly, the ages probed by these designations remain broad, change with spectral type, and depend on the gravity sensitive index used. Gravity designations are useful indicators of the possibility of youth, but current datasets cannot be used to provide a precise age estimate.},

A member of the 23{\$}\backslashpm{\$}3 Myr {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic moving group, PSO J318.5-22 has T{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\$} = 1160{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+30{\}}{\_}{\{}-40{\}}{\$} K and a mass estimate of 8.3{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.5 M{\$}{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$} for a 23{\$}\backslashpm{\$}3 Myr age. PSO J318.5-22 is intermediate in mass between 51 Eri b and {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic b, the two known exoplanet companions in the {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic moving group. With variability amplitudes from 7-10{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} in J{\$}{\_}{\{}S{\}}{\$} at two separate epochs over 3-5 hour observations, we constrain the rotational period of this object to {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}5 hours. In K{\$}{\_}{\{}S{\}}{\$}, we marginally detect a variability trend of up to 3{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} over a 3 hour observation. This is the first detection of weather on an extrasolar planetary mass object. Among L dwarfs surveyed at high-photometric precision ({\$}{\textless}{\$}3{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) this is the highest amplitude variability detection. Given the low surface gravity of this object, the high amplitude preliminarily suggests that such objects may be more variable than their high mass counterparts, although observations of a larger sample is necessary to confirm this. Measuring similar variability for directly imaged planetary companions is possible with instruments such as SPHERE and GPI and will provide important constraints on formation. Measuring variability at multiple wavelengths can help constrain cloud structure.},

abstract = {A principal scientific goal of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is obtaining milliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits. However, astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases, systematic errors, and speckle noise. Here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of an exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and spectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Lo$\backslash$`eve Image Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position of an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to account for correlated noise. In the case of GPI data on {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM Astrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}-errors at or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by fitting a Keplerian orbit to twelve GPI observations along with previous astrometry from other instruments. The statistical properties of the residuals confirm that BKA is accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors. Our constraints on the orbit of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the planet at 10-{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pic b will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the circumplanetary environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an ephemeris for photometric monitoring of the Hill sphere transit event, which will begin at the start of April in 2017 and finish at the end of January in 2018.},

abstract = {Using a model for refractory clouds, a novel algorithm for handling them, and the latest gas-phase molecular opacities, we have produced a new series of L and T dwarf spectral and atmosphere models as a function of gravity and metallicity, spanning the $\backslash$teff range from 2200 K to 700 K. The correspondence with observed spectra and infrared colors for early- and mid-L dwarfs and for mid- to late-T dwarfs is good. We find that the width in infrared color-magnitude diagrams of both the T and L dwarf branches is naturally explained by reasonable variations in gravity and, therefore, that gravity is the "second parameter" of the L/T dwarf sequence. We investigate the dependence of theoretical dwarf spectra and color-magnitude diagrams upon various cloud properties, such as particle size and cloud spatial distribution. In the region of the L{\$}\backslashto{\$}T transition, we find that no one cloud-particle-size and gravity combination can be made to fit all the observed data. Furthermore, we note that the new, lower solar oxygen abundances of Allende-Prieto, Lambert, {\&} Asplund (2002) produce better fits to brown dwarf data than do the older values. Finally, we discuss various issues in cloud physics and modeling and speculate on how a better correspondence between theory and observation in the problematic L{\$}\backslashto{\$}T transition region might be achieved.},

@article{Williams2018,
abstract = {I discuss three mutually-supportive notions or assumptions regarding jets and accretion. The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the overwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady accreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The third is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading directly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that is simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect. For concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in accretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical work directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic ("viscous") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective radiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission problem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar to breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar, permitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow than otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent, tangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an angular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve. Moreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate but to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then vertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then that jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar jets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven.},

From spectral deconvolution of integrated-light near-IR spectroscopy of SCH1609 using the SpeX spectrograph (Rayner et al. 2003), we estimate primary and secondary spectral types of M6 ± 0.5 and M7 ± 1.0, corresponding to masses of 79 ± 17 M Jup and 55 ± 25 M Jup at an age of 5 Myr and masses of 84 ± 15 M Jup and 60 ± 25 M Jup at an age of 10 Myr.

We combine the results of our survey with previous surveys of Upper Sco and similar young regions to set the strongest constraints to date on binary fraction for young substellar objects and very low mass stars. The binary fraction for low-mass ({\textless}40 M Jup) brown dwarfs in Upper Sco is similar to that for T dwarfs in the field; for higher mass brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, there is an excess of medium-separation (10-50 AU projected separation) young binaries with respect to the field.

abstract = {▪ Abstract The establishment of new spectral classes cooler than type M has had a brief, yet already rich, history. Prototypes of the new “L dwarf” and “T dwarf” classes were first found in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, with a flood of new discoveries occurring in the late 1990s with the advent of deep, large-area, digital sky surveys. Over four hundred and fifty L and T dwarfs are now cataloged. This review concentrates on the spectroscopic properties of these objects, beginning with the establishment of classification schemes rooted in the MK Process. The resulting grid of spectral types is then used as a tool to ferret out the underlying physics. The temperature ranges covered by these spectral types, the complex chemical processes responsible for the shape of their emergent spectra, their nature as either true stars or brown dwarfs, and their number density in the Galaxy are discussed. Two promising avenues for future research are also explored: the extension of the classification system to three dimen...},

abstract = {We suggest a new algorithm to remove systematic effects in a large set of lightcurves obtained by a photometric survey. The algorithm can remove systematic effects, like the ones associated with atmospheric extinction, detector efficiency, or PSF changes over the detector. The algorithm works without any prior knowledge of the effects, as long as they linearly appear in many stars of the sample. The approach, which was originally developed to remove atmospheric extinction effects, is based on a lower rank approximation of matrices, an approach which was already suggested and used in chemometrics, for example. The proposed algorithm is specially useful in cases where the uncertainties of the measurements are unequal. For equal uncertainties the algorithm reduces to the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) algorithm. We present a simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and point out its potential, in search for transit candidates in particular.},

This paper shows that the subtle differences between the filters proposed for these surveys and those from ground-based photometric systems will produce a ground-space colour term that is dependent on water absorption in the spectra of astronomical objects. This colour term can be used to identify free-floating planets in star forming regions, mimicking a successful ground-based technique that uses a filter sensitive to water absorption. This paper shows that this colour term is an effective discriminant between reddened background stars and ultracool dwarfs.

abstract = {We present new evolution sequences for very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and giant planets and use them to explore a variety of influences on the evolution of these objects. While the predicted adiabatic evolution of luminosity with time is very similar to results of previous work, the remaining disagreements reveal the magnitude of current uncertainty in brown dwarf evolution theory. We discuss the sources of those differences and argue for the importance of the surface boundary condition provided by atmosphere models including clouds. The L- to T-type ultracool dwarf transition can be accommodated within the Ackerman and Marley cloud model by varying the cloud sedimentation parameter. We develop a simple model for the evolution across the L/T transition. By combining the evolution calculation and our atmosphere models, we generate colors and magnitudes of synthetic populations of ultracool dwarfs in the field and in Galactic clusters. We focus on near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and on the nature of the ``second parameter'' that is responsible for the scatter of colors along the Teff sequence. Instead of a single second parameter we find that variations in metallicity and cloud parameters, unresolved binaries, and possibly a relatively young population all play a role in defining the spread of brown dwarfs along the cooling sequence. We also find that the transition from cloudy L dwarfs to cloudless T dwarfs slows down the evolution and causes a pileup of substellar objects in the transition region, in contradiction with previous studies. However, the same model is applied to the Pleiades brown dwarf sequence with less success. Taken at face value, the present Pleiades data suggest that the L/T transition occurs at lower Teff for lower gravity objects, such as those found in young Galactic clusters. The simulated populations of brown dwarfs also reveal that the phase of deuterium burning produces a distinctive feature in CMDs that should be detectable in {\~{}}50-100 Myr old clusters.},

abstract = {High-contrast adaptive optics (AO) imaging is a powerful technique to probe the architectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the atmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of high-order AO systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on observations of 384 unique and single young (≈5–300 Myr) stars spanning stellar masses between 0.1 and 3.0 M e , the overall occurrence rate of 5–13 M Jup companions at orbital distances of 30–300 au is -+ 0.6 {\%} 0.5 0.7 assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically significant trend in planet frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around -+ 2.8 {\%} 2.3 3.7 of BA stars, {\textless}4.1{\%} of FGK stars, and {\textless}3.9{\%} of M dwarfs. Looking forward, extreme AO systems and the next generation of ground-and space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics, composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses and ages.},

The wide separation to its host star of 7.1" makes it an ideal candidate for high-SNR and high-resolution spectroscopy. We aim to derive new constraints on HD 106906b's spectral type, effective temperature, and luminosity, and also provide a high-SNR template spectrum for future characterization of extrasolar planets. We obtained 1.1--2.5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m integral field spectroscopy with the VLT/SINFONI instrument with a spectral resolution of R{\$}\backslashapprox{\$}2000--4000. New estimates of HD 106906b's parameters are derived by analyzing spectral features, comparing to spectral catalogs of other low-mass objects, and fitting with theoretical isochrones. We identify several spectral absorption lines that are consistent with a low mass for HD 106906b. We derive a new spectral type of L1.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.0, one subclass earlier than previous estimates. Through comparison with other young low-mass objects, this translates to a luminosity of log({\$}L/L{\_}\backslashodot{\$})={\$}-3.65\backslashpm0.08{\$} and an effective temperature of Teff = {\$}1820\backslashpm240{\$} K.

This census is built from a literature compilation supplemented with new spectra and 17 new radial velocities, as well as a re-analysis of Hipparcos data that confirmed HR 4334 (A2Vn) as a member. Though the dominant uncertainty in the IMF remains census incompleteness, a detailed statistical treatment is carried out to make the IMF determination independent of binning, while accounting for small number statistics. The currently known high-likelihood members are fitted by a log-normal distribution with a central mass of {\$}0.21{\^{}}{\{}+0.11{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.06{\}}{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and a characteristic width of {\$}0.8{\^{}}{\{}+0.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.1{\}}{\$} dex in the 12 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}-2 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} range, whereas a Salpeter power law with {\$}\backslashalpha = 2.2{\^{}}{\{}+1.1{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.5{\}}{\$} best describes the IMF slope in the {\$}0.1-2{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} range. This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which may be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A tentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2MASS J11472421-2040204 and 2MASS J11193254-1137466 is identified: this indicates that there might be as many as {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}+13{\}}{\_}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} similar members of TWA with hot-start model-dependent masses estimated at {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 5-7 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}, most of which would be too faint to be detected in 2MASS.

abstract = {Nine transiting Earth-sized planets have recently been discovered around nearby late M dwarfs, including the TRAPPIST-1 planets and two planets discovered by the MEarth survey, GJ 1132b and LHS 1140b. These planets are the smallest known planets that may have atmospheres amenable to detection with JWST. We present model thermal emission and transmission spectra for each planet, varying composition and surface pressure of the atmosphere. We base elemental compositions on those of Earth, Titan, and Venus and calculate the molecular compositions assuming chemical equilibrium, which can strongly depend on temperature. Both thermal emission and transmission spectra are sensitive to the atmospheric composition; thermal emission spectra are sensitive to surface pressure and temperature. We predict the observability of each planet's atmosphere with JWST. GJ 1132b and TRAPPIST-1b are excellent targets for emission spectroscopy with JWST/MIRI, requiring fewer than 10 eclipse observations. Emission photometry for TRAPPIST-1c requires 5-15 eclipses; LHS 1140b and TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e, and TRAPPIST-1f, which could possibly have surface liquid water, may be accessible with photometry. Seven of the nine planets are strong candidates for transmission spectroscopy measurements with JWST, though the number of transits required depends strongly on the planets' actual masses. Using the measured masses, fewer than 20 transits are required for a 5 sigma detection of spectral features for GJ 1132b and six of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Dedicated campaigns to measure the atmospheres of these nine planets will allow us, for the first time, to probe formation and evolution processes of terrestrial planetary atmospheres beyond our solar system.},

This L4 $\gamma$ companion has been discovered with seeing-limited direct imaging observations; at a 4″ separation (160 AU) and a modest contrast ratio, it joins the very short list of young low-mass companions amenable to study without the aid of adaptive optics, enabling its characterization with a much wider suite of instruments than is possible for companions uncovered by high-contrast imaging surveys. With a model-dependent mass of 12-15 M{\textless}inf{\textgreater}JUP{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, it straddles the boundary between the planet and brown dwarf mass regimes. We present near-infrared spectroscopy of this companion and compare it to various similar objects uncovered in the last few years. The J0219-3925 system falls in a sparsely populated part of the host mass versus mass ratio diagram for binaries; the dearth of known similar companions may be due to observational biases in previous low-mass companion searches.},

abstract = {Previous measurements of heat redistribution efficiency (the ability to transport energy from a planet's highly irradiated dayside to its eternally dark nightside) show considerable variation between exoplanets. Theoretical models predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency and temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b spectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve observations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6 micron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking unphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other visits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST data. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would need to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal emission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly retrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high altitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating ({\$}\backslashlesssim1{\$} day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting measured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current Spitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission measurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O abundance ({\$}2.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} - 1.1\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} at 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence) and, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we derive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar (0.4 -- 1.7). Using the retrieved global CO+CO2 abundance under the same assumptions, we estimate a comparable metallicity of 0.3 - 1.7{\$}\backslashtimes{\$} solar. (Abridged)},

abstract = {Whether BDs form as stars through gravitational collapse ("star-like") or BDs and some very low-mass stars constitute a separate population which form alongside stars comparable to the population of planets, e.g. through circumstellar disk ("peripheral") fragmentation, is one of the key questions of the star-formation problem. For young stars in Taurus-Auriga the binary fraction is large with little dependence on primary mass above {\~{}}0.2Msun, while for BDs it is {\textless}10{\%}. We investigate a case in which BDs in Taurus formed dominantly through peripheral fragmentation. The decline of the binary frequency in the transition region between star-like and peripheral formation is modelled. A dynamical population synthesis model is employed in which stellar binary formation is universal. Peripheral objects form separately in circumstellar disks with a distinctive initial mass function (IMF), own orbital parameter distributions for binaries and a low binary fraction. A small amount of dynamical processing of the stellar component is accounted for as appropriate for the low-density Taurus-Auriga embedded clusters. The binary fraction declines strongly between the mass-limits for star-like and peripheral formation. The location of characteristic features and the steepness depend on these mass-limits. Such a trend might be unique to low density regions hosting dynamically unprocessed binary populations. The existence of a strong decline in the binary fraction -- primary mass diagram will become verifiable in future surveys on BD and VLMS binarity in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. It is a test of the (non-)continuity of star formation along the mass-scale, the separateness of the stellar and BD populations and the dominant formation channel for BDs and BD binaries in regions of low stellar density hosting dynamically unprocessed populations.},

abstract = {The outer solar system provides a unique, quiet vantage point from which to observe the universe around us, where measurements could enable several niche astrophysical science cases that are too difficult to perform near Earth. NASA's New Horizons mission comprises an instrument package that provides imaging capability from UV to near-IR wavelengths with moderate spectral resolution located beyond the orbit of Pluto. A carefully designed survey with New Horizons can optimize the use of expendable propellant and the limited data telemetry bandwidth to allow several measurements, including a detailed understanding of the cosmic extragalactic background light, studies of the local and extragalactic UV background, measurements of the properties of dust and ice in the outer solar system, searches for moons and other faint structures around exoplanets, determinations of the mass of planets using gravitational microlensing, and rapid follow-up of transient events. New Horizons is currently in an extended mission designed to survey the Kuiper Belt Object 2014 MU69 that will conclude in 2021. The astrophysics community has a unique, generational opportunity to use this mission for astronomical observation at heliocentric distances beyond 50 AU in the next decade. In this paper, we discuss the potential science cases for such an extended mission, and provide an initial assessment of the most important operational requirements and observation strategies it would require. We conclude that New Horizons is capable of transformative science, and that it would make a valuable and unique asset for astrophysical science that is unlikely to be replicated in the near future.},

abstract = {Context. Convergent point (CP) search methods are important tools for studying the kinematic properties of open clusters and young associations whose members share the same spatial motion. Aims: We present a new CP search strategy based on proper motion data. We test the new algorithm on synthetic data and compare it with previous versions of the CP search method. As an illustration and validation of the new method we also present an application to the Hyades open cluster and a comparison with independent results. Methods: The new algorithm rests on the idea of representing the stellar proper motions by great circles over the celestial sphere and visualizing their intersections as the CP of the moving group. The new strategy combines a maximum-likelihood analysis for simultaneously determining the CP and selecting the most likely group members and a minimization procedure that returns a refined CP position and its uncertainties. The method allows one to correct for internal motions within the group and takes into account that the stars in the group lie at different distances. Results: Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the new CP search method in many cases returns a more precise solution than its previous versions. The new method is able to find and eliminate more field stars in the sample and is not biased towards distant stars. The CP solution for the Hyades open cluster is in excellent agreement with previous determinations.},

abstract = {Context. Photometric monitoring of the variability of brown dwarfs can provide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold atmospheres. The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target for such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high levels of variability. Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the Solar system, allowing precise astrometric investigations with ground-based facilities. Aims. The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and study the astrometric motion of both components. Methods. We have monitored Luhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla, through a special i+z long-pass filter, which allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects. An intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which we observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 $\backslash$pm 0.02 mag and 0.34 $\backslash$pm 0.02 mag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. Results. We used the 16-night time-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. We found that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 $\backslash$pm 0.1 hr, in very good agreement with previous measurements. For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates slower than its companion and, even though we were not able to get a robust determination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 hr. This implies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and suggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion process. The 2-year complete dataset was used to study the astrometric motion of Luhman 16AB. We predict a motion of the system that is not consistent with a previous estimate based on two months of monitoring, but cannot confirm or refute the presence of additional planetary-mass bodies in the system.},

These clouds are globally neutral obeying dust-gas charge equilibrium which is, on short time scales, inconsistent with the observation of stochastic ionisation events of the solar system planets. We argue that a significant volume of the clouds in Brown Dwarfs and extrasolar planets is susceptible to local discharge events. These are electron avalanches triggered by charged dust grains. Such intra-cloud discharges occur on time scales shorter than the time needed to neutralise the dust grains by collisional processes. An ensemble of discharges is likely to produce enough free charges to suggest a partial and stochastic coupling of the atmosphere to a large-scale magnetic field.},

abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR channel is extensively used in time-resolved observations, especially for transiting exoplanet spectroscopy and brown dwarf and directly imaged exoplanet rotational phase mapping. The ramp effect is the dominant source of systematics in the WFC3 for time-resolved observations, which limits its photometric precision. Current mitigation strategies are based on empirical fits and require additional orbits "to help the telescope reach a thermal equilibrium". We show that the ramp effect profiles can be explained and corrected with high fidelity using charge trapping theories. We also present a model for this process that can be used to predict and to correct charge trap systematics. Our model is based on a very small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the detector. We find that these parameters are very stable between the different datasets, and we provide best-fit values. Our model is tested with more than 120 orbits ({\$}\backslashsim40{\$} visits) of WFC3 observations and is proved to be able to provide near photon noise limited corrections for observations made with both staring and scanning modes of transiting exoplanets as well as for starting-mode observations of brown dwarfs. After our model correction, the light curve of the first orbit in each visit has the same photometric precision as subsequent orbits, so data from the first orbit need no longer be discarded. Near IR arrays with the same physical characteristics (e.g., JWST/NIRCam) may also benefit from the extension of this model, if similar systematic profiles are observed.},

Applying our method across the full GALEX- covered sky, we identify 2031 mostly M-type stars that, for an assumed age of 10 (100) Myr, all lie within {\~{}}150 ({\~{}}90) pc of Earth. The distribution of M spectral subclasses among these {\~{}}2000 candidate young stars peaks sharply in the range M3-M4; these subtypes constitute 50{\%} of the sample, consistent with studies of the M star population in the immediate solar neighborhood. We focus on a subset of 58 of these candidate young M stars in the vicinity of the Tucana-Horologium Association. Only 20 of these 58 candidates were detected in the ROSAT All-Sky X-ray Survey -- reflecting the greater sensitivity of GALEX for purposes of identifying active nearby, young stars, particularly for stars of type M4 and later. Based on statistical analysis of the kinematics and/or spectroscopic followup of these 58 M stars, we find that 50{\%} (29 stars) indeed have properties consistent with Tuc-Hor membership, while 12 are potential new members of the Columba Association, and two may be AB Dor moving group members. Hence, {\~{}}75{\%} of our initial subsample of 58 candidates are likely members of young (age {\~{}}10-40 Myr) stellar moving groups within 100 pc, verifying that the stellar color- and kinematics-based selection algorithms described here can be used to efficiently isolate nearby, young, low-mass objects from among the field star population. Future studies will focus on characterizing additional subsamples selected from among this list of candidate nearby, young M stars.},

abstract = {We present the first detection of photometric variability of a spectroscopically-confirmed Y dwarf. The Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope was used to obtain times series photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 microns over a twenty four hour period at two different epochs separated by 149 days. Variability is evident at 4.5 um in the first epoch and at 3.6 and 4.5 um in the second epoch which suggests that the underlying cause or causes of this variability change on the timescales of months. The second-epoch [3.6] and [4.5] light curves are nearly sinusoidal in form, in phase, have periods of roughly 8.5 hours, and have semi-amplitudes of 3.5{\%}. We find that a simple geometric spot model with a single bright spot reproduces these observations well. We also compare our measured semi-amplitudes of the second epoch light curves to predictions of the static, one-dimensional, partly cloudy and hot spot models of Morley and collaborators and find that neither set of models can reproduce the observed [3.6] and[4.5] semi-amplitudes simultaneously. More advanced two- or three-dimensional models that include time-dependent phenomena like vertical mixing, cloud formation, and thermal relaxation are therefore sorely needed in order to properly interpret our observations.},

abstract = {The admitted, conventional scenario to explain the complex spectral evolution of brown dwarfs (BD) since their first detections twenty years ago, has always been the key role played by micron-size condensates, called "dust" or "clouds", in their atmosphere. This scenario, however, faces major problems, in particular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L to T transition, and a physical first-principle understanding of this transition is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new, completely different explanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution, without the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the CO/CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and EGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature to the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and at the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy transport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the observed increase in near infrared J-H and J-K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs, while a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the CO/CH4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles, and provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition. This new picture leads to a drastic revision of our understanding of BD and EGP atmospheres and their evolution.},

abstract = {Brown dwarf spectra are rich in information revealing of the chemical and physical processes operating in their atmospheres. We apply a recently developed atmospheric retrieval tool to an ensemble of late T-dwarf (600-800K) near infrared spectra. With these spectra we are able to place direct constraints the molecular abundances of H{\$}{\_}2{\$}O, CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}, CO, CO{\$}{\_}2{\$}, NH{\$}{\_}3{\$}, H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S, and Na+K, gravity, thermal structure (and effective temperature), photometric radius, and cloud optical depths. We find that ammonia, water, methane, and the alkali metals are present and well constrained in all 11 objects. From the abundance constraints we find no significant trend in the water, methane, or ammonia abundances with temperature, but find a very strong ({\$}{\textgreater}{\$}25{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}) increasing trend in the alkali metal abundances with effective temperature, indicative of alkali rainout. We also find little evidence for optically thick clouds. With the methane and water abundances, we derive the intrinsic atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratios. We find in our sample, that metallicities are typically sub solar and carbon-to-oxygen ratios are somewhat super solar, different than expectations from the local stellar population. We also find that the retrieved vertical thermal profiles are consistent with radiative equilibrium over the photospheric regions. Finally, we find that our retrieved effective temperatures are lower than previous inferences for some objects and that our radii are larger than expectations from evolutionary models, possibly indicative of un-resolved binaries. This investigation and methodology represents a paradigm in linking spectra to the determination of the fundamental chemical and physical processes governing cool brown dwarf atmospheres.},

abstract = {The impact of the stellar mass on the giant planet properties is still to be fully understood. Main-Sequence (MS) stars more massive than the Sun remain relatively unexplored in radial velocity (RV) surveys, due to their characteristics that hinder classical RV measurements. Our aim is to characterize the close (up to 2.5 au) giant planet (GP) and brown dwarf (BD) population around AF MS stars and compare this population to stars with different masses. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph located on the 1.93m telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence to observe 125 northern, MS AF dwarfs. We used our dedicated SAFIR software to compute the RV and other spectroscopic observables. We characterized the detected sub-stellar companions and computed the GP and BD occurrence rates combining the present SOPHIE survey and a similar HARPS survey. We present new data on two known planetary systems around the F5-6V dwarfs HD16232 and HD113337. For the latter, we report an additional RV variation that might be induced by a second GP on a wider orbit. We also report the detection of fifteen binaries or massive sub-stellar companions with high-amplitude RV variations or long-term RV trends. Based on 225 targets observed with SOPHIE or HARPS, we constraint the BD frequency within 2-3 au around AF stars to be below 4 percents (1-sigma). For Jupiter-mass GP within 2-3 au (periods below 1000 days), we found the occurrence rate to be 3.7 (+3/-1) percents around AF stars with masses below 1.5 solar masses, and to be below 6 percents around AF stars with masses above 1.5 solar masses. For periods smaller than 10 days, we find the GP occurrence rate to be below 3 or 4.5 percents, respectively. Our results are compatible with the GP frequency reported around FGK dwarfs and are compatible with a possible increase of GP orbital periods with the stellar mass as predicted by formation models.},

abstract = {We identify the pressure--broadened red wings of the saturated potassium resonance lines at 7700 $\backslash$AA as the source of anomalous absorption seen in the near-infrared spectra of Gliese 229B and, by extension, of methane dwarfs in general. This conclusion is supported by the recent work of Tsuji {\{}$\backslash$it et al.{\}} 1999, though unlike them we find that dust need not be invoked to explain the spectra of methane dwarfs shortward of 1 micron. We find that a combination of enhanced alkali abundances due to rainout and a more realistic non-Lorentzian theory of resonant line shapes may be all that is needed to properly account for these spectra from 0.5 to 1.0 microns. The WFPC2 {\$}I{\$} measurement of Gliese 229B is also consistent with this theory. Furthermore, a combination of the blue wings of this K I resonance doublet, the red wings of the Na D lines at 5890 $\backslash$AA, and, perhaps, the Li I line at 6708 $\backslash$AA can explain in a natural way the observed WFPC2 {\$}R{\$} band flux of Gliese 229B. Hence, we conclude that the neutral alkali metals play a central role in the near-infrared and optical spectra of methane dwarfs and that their lines have the potential to provide crucial diagnostics of brown dwarfs. We speculate on the systematics of the near-infrared and optical spectra of methane dwarfs, for a given mass and composition, that stems from the progressive burial with decreasing $\backslash$teff of the alkali metal atoms to larger pressures and depths.},

We present 22 nights of photometry of 2MASSW J0036159+182110, including 7 nights of simultaneous, multiwavelength photometry, spread over {\~{}}120 days allowing us to determine the rotation period of this ultra-cool dwarf to be 3.080 +/- 0.001 hr. Our many nights of multiwavelength photometry allow us to observe the evolution, or more specifically the lack thereof, of the light curve over a great many rotation periods. The lack of discernible phase shifts in our multiwavelength photometry, and that the amplitude of variability generally decreases as one moves to longer wavelengths for 2MASSW J0036159+182110, is generally consistent with starspots driving the variability on this ultra-cool dwarf, with starspots that are {\~{}}100 degrees K hotter or cooler than the {\~{}}1700 K photosphere. Also, reasonably thick clouds are required to fit the spectra of 2MASSW J0036159+182110, suggesting there likely exists some complex interplay between the starspots driving the variability of this ultra-cool dwarf and the clouds that appear to envelope this ultra-cool dwarf.},

abstract = {We present the first results from applying the spectral inversion technique in the cloudy L dwarf regime. Our new framework provides a flexible approach to modelling cloud opacity which can be built incrementally as the data requires, and improves upon previous retrieval experiments in the brown dwarf regime by allowing for scattering in two stream radiative transfer. Our first application of the tool to two mid-L dwarfs is able to reproduce their near-infrared spectra far more closely than grid models. Our retrieved thermal, chemical, and cloud profiles allow us to estimate {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} = 1796{\^{}}{\{}+23{\}}{\_}{\{}-25{\}}{\$} K and {\$}\backslashlog g = 5.21{\^{}}{\{}+0.05{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.08{\}}{\$} for 2MASS J05002100+0330501 and for 2MASSW J2224438-015852 we find {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} = 1723{\^{}}{\{}+18{\}}{\_}{\{}-19{\}}{\$} K and {\$}\backslashlog g = 5.31{\^{}}{\{}+0.04{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.08{\}}{\$}, in close agreement with previous empirical estimates. Our best model for both objects includes an optically thick cloud deck which passes {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}cloud{\}} \backslashgeq 1{\$} (looking down) at a pressure of around 5 bar. The temperature at this pressure is too high for silicate species to condense, and we argue that corundum and/or iron clouds are responsible for this cloud opacity. Our retrieved profiles are cooler at depth, and warmer at altitude than the forward grid models that we compare, and we argue that some form of heating mechanism may be at work in the upper atmospheres of these L dwarfs. We also identify anomalously high CO abundance in both targets, which does not correlate with the warmth of our upper atmospheres or our choice of cloud model, and find similarly anomalous alkali abundance for one of our targets. These anomalies may reflect unrecognised shortcomings in our retrieval model, or inaccuracies in our gas phase opacities.},

abstract = {We report the results of an infrared Doppler survey designed to detect brown dwarf and giant planetary companions to a magnitude-limited sample of ultracool dwarfs. Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph on the Keck II telescope, we obtained approximately 600 radial velocity measurements over a period of six years for a sample of 59 late-M and L dwarfs spanning spectral types M8/L0 to L6. A subsample of 46 of our targets have been observed on three or more epochs. We rely on telluric CH4 absorption features in the Earth's atmosphere as a simultaneous wavelength reference and exploit the rich set of CO absorption features found in the K-band spectra of cool stars and brown dwarfs to measure radial velocities and projected rotational velocities. For a bright, slowly rotating M dwarf standard we demonstrate a radial velocity precision of 50 m/s, and for slowly rotating L dwarfs we achieve a typical radial velocity precision of approximately 200 m/s. This precision is sufficient for the detection of close-in giant planetary companions to mid-L dwarfs as well as more equal mass spectroscopic binary systems with small separations (a{\textless}2 AU). We present an orbital solution for the subdwarf binary LSR1610-0040 as well as an improved solution for the M/T binary 2M0320-04. We also combine our radial velocity measurements with distance estimates and proper motions from the literature to estimate the dispersion of the space velocities of the objects in our sample. Using a kinematic age estimate we conclude that our UCDs have an age of 5.0+0.7-0.6 Gyr, similar to that of nearby sun-like stars. We simulate the efficiency with which we detect spectroscopic binaries and find that the rate of tight (a{\textless}1 AU) binaries in our sample is 2.5+8.6-1.6{\%}, consistent with recent estimates in the literature of a tight binary fraction of 3-4{\%}.

abstract = {Based on high-resolution spectra obtained with PHOENIX at Gemini-South, CRIRES at VLT-UT1, and ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we present new measurements of the radial and projected rotational velocities of 219 low-mass stars. The target likely membership was initially established using the Bayesian analysis tool recently presented in Malo et al., taking into account only the position, proper motion, and photometry of the stars to assess their membership probability. In the present study, we include radial velocity as an additional input to our analysis, and in doing so we confirm the high membership probability for 130 candidates: 27 in $\beta$ Pictoris, 22 in Tucana-Horologium, 25 in Columba, 7 in Carina, 18 in Argus and 18 in AB Doradus, and 13 with an ambiguous membership. Our analysis also confirms the membership of 57 stars proposed in the literature. A subsample of 16 candidates was observed at 3 or more epochs, allowing us to discover 6 new spectroscopic binaries. The fraction of binaries in our sample is 25{\%}, consistent with values in the literature. Of the stars in our sample, 20{\%} show projected rotational velocities (vsin i) higher than 30 km s-1 and therefore are considered as fast rotators. A parallax and other youth indicators are still needed to fully confirm the 130 highly probable candidates identified here as new bona fide members. Finally, based on the X-ray emission of bona fide and highly probable group members, we show that for low-mass stars in the 12-120 Myr age range, the X-ray luminosity is an excellent indicator of youth and better than the more traditionally used R X parameter, the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity.},

Rotational velocities are found to increase from mid-M to L. This is consistent with a lengthening of spin-down timescale with later type, though in the L types the trend may also be a function of stellar age. From M5 to M8.5, a saturation-type rotation-activity relation is seen, similar to that in earlier types. However, the saturation velocity in our case is much higher, at about 12 km/s. A sharp drop in activity is observed at about M9, with later types showing little or no H-alpha emission, in spite of rapid rotation. This may be due to the very high resistivities in the predominantly neutral atmospheres of these cool objects.},

abstract = {Most directly imaged giant exoplanets are fainter than brown dwarfs with similar spectra. To explain their relative underluminosity, unusually cloudy atmospheres have been proposed. However, with multiple parameters varying between any two objects, it remained difficult to observationally test this idea. We present a new method, sensitive time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared spectroscopy, to study two rotating L/T transition brown dwarfs (2M2139 and SIMP0136). The observations provide spatially and spectrally resolved mapping of the cloud decks of the brown dwarfs. The data allow the study of cloud structure variations while other parameters are unchanged. We find that both brown dwarfs display variations of identical nature: J- and H-band brightness variations with minimal color and spectral changes. Our light curve models show that even the simplest surface brightness distributions require at least three elliptical spots. We show that for each source the spectral changes can be reproduced with a linear combination of only two different spectra, i.e., the entire surface is covered by two distinct types of regions. Modeling the color changes and spectral variations together reveal patchy cloud covers consisting of a spatially heterogeneous mix of low-brightness, low-temperature thick clouds and brighter, thin, and warm clouds. We show that the same thick cloud patches seen in our varying brown dwarf targets, if extended to the entire photosphere, predict near-infrared colors/magnitudes matching the range occupied by the directly imaged exoplanets that are cooler and less luminous than brown dwarfs with similar spectral types. This supports the models in which thick clouds are responsible for the near-infrared properties of these underluminous exoplanets.},

abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. They are both examples of "functional data", which have become a prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as time warping, manifold learning, and dynamic modeling with empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

abstract = {{In a search for common proper motion companions using the VISTA Hemisphere Survey and 2MASS catalogs we have identified a very red (J-Ks=2.47 mag) late-L dwarf companion of a previously unrecognized M dwarf VHS J125601.92-125723.9, located at a projected angular separation of 8.06"+/-0.03". From low-resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy we classified the primary and the companion as an M7.5+/-0.5 and L7+/-1.5, respectively. The primary shows weaker alkali lines than field dwarfs of similar spectral type, but still consistent with either a high-gravity dwarf or a younger object of hundreds of millions of years. The secondary shows spectral features characteristic for low surface gravity objects at ages below several hundred Myr, like the triangular shape of the H-band continuum and alkali lines weaker than in field dwarfs of the same spectral type. The absence of lithium in the atmosphere of the primary and the likely membership to the Local Association allowed us to constrain the age of the system to the range of 150-300 Myr. We report a measurement of the trigonometric parallax pi=78.8+/-6.4 mas, which translates into a distance of 12.7+/-1.0 pc; the pair thus has a projected physical separation of 102+/-9 AU. We derived the Lbol of the components and compared them with theoretical evolutionary models to estimate the masses and effective temperatures. For the primary, we determined log(Lbol/LSun)=-3.14+/-0.10, and a mass of 73 (+20,-15{\}} MJup at the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs and Teff of 2620+/-140 K. For the companion we obtained log(Lbol/LSun)=-5.05+/-0.22 and a mass of 11.2 (+9.7,-1.8) MJup placing it near the deuterium-burning mass limit. The effective temperature derived from evolutionary models is 880 (+140,-110) K, about 400-700 K cooler than expected for field late-L dwarfs.},

abstract = {Doppler Imaging produces 2D global maps of rotating objects using high-dispersion spectroscopy. When applied to brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets, this technique can constrain global atmospheric dynamics and/or magnetic effects on these objects in un- precedented detail. I present the first quantitative assessment of the prospects for Doppler Imaging of substellar objects with current facilities and with future giant ground-based telescopes. Observations will have the greatest sensitivity in K band, but the H and L bands will also be useful for these purposes. To assess the number and availability of targets, I also present a compilation of all measurements of photometric variability, rotation period (P), and projected rotational velocity (v sin i) for brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Several bright objects are already accessible to Doppler Imaging with currently available instruments. With the development of giant ground-based telescopes, Doppler Imaging will become feasible for many dozens of brown dwarfs and for the few brightest directly imaged extrasolar planets (such as beta Pic b). The present set of measurements of P, v sin i, and variability are incomplete for many objects, and the sample is strongly biased toward early-type objects ({\textless} L5). Thus, surveys to measure these quantities for later-type objects will be especially helpful in expanding the sample of candidates for global weather monitoring via Doppler Imaging.},

Targets primarily have distances within 20 pc of the Sun, with more distant sources selected for their unusual spectral energy distributions. We achieved precisions of 2--3 km/s, and combined these with astrometric and spectrophotometric data to calculate {\$}UVW{\$} velocities. Most are members of the thin disk of the Galaxy, and velocity dispersions indicate a mean age of 5.2{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.2 Gyr for sources within 20 pc. We find significantly different kinematic ages between late-M dwarfs (4.0{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.2 Gyr) and L dwarfs (6.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.4 Gyr) in our sample that are contrary to predictions from prior simulations. This difference appears to be driven by a dispersed population of unusually blue L dwarfs which may be more prevalent in our local volume-limited sample than in deeper magnitude-limited surveys. The L dwarfs exhibit an asymmetric {\$}U{\$} velocity distribution with a net inward flow, similar to gradients recently detected in local stellar samples. Simulations incorporating brown dwarf evolution and Galactic orbital dynamics are unable to reproduce the velocity asymmetry, suggesting non-axisymmetric perturbations or two distinct L dwarf populations. We also find the L dwarfs to have a kinematic age-activity correlation similar to more massive stars. We identify several sources with low surface gravities, and two new substellar candidate members of nearby young moving groups: the astrometric binary DENIS J08230313{\$}-{\$}4912012AB, a low-probability member of the {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} Pictoris Moving Group; and 2MASS J15104786-2818174, a moderate-probability member of the 30-50 Myr Argus Association.},

abstract = {Several exoplanets have recently been imaged at wide separations of {\textgreater}10 AU from their parent stars. These span a limited range of ages ({\textless}50 Myr) and atmospheric properties, with temperatures of 800--1800 K and very red colors (J - H {\textgreater} 0.5 mag), implying thick cloud covers. Furthermore, substantial model uncertainties exist at these young ages due to the unknown initial conditions at formation, which can lead to an order of magnitude of uncertainty in the modeled planet mass. Here, we report the direct imaging discovery of a Jovian exoplanet around the Sun-like star GJ 504, detected as part of the SEEDS survey. The system is older than all other known directly-imaged planets; as a result, its estimated mass remains in the planetary regime independent of uncertainties related to choices of initial conditions in the exoplanet modeling. Using the most common exoplanet cooling model, and given the system age of 160 [+350, -60] Myr, GJ 504 b has an estimated mass of 4 [+4.5, -1.0] Jupiter masses, among the lowest of directly imaged planets. Its projected separation of 43.5 AU exceeds the typical outer boundary of {\~{}}30 AU predicted for the core accretion mechanism. GJ 504 b is also significantly cooler (510 [+30, -20] K) and has a bluer color (J-H = -0.23 mag) than previously imaged exoplanets, suggesting a largely cloud-free atmosphere accessible to spectroscopic characterization. Thus, it has the potential of providing novel insights into the origins of giant planets, as well as their atmospheric properties.},

We detect strongly variable and periodic radio emission (P=3 hr) with a fraction of about 60{\%} circular polarization. No X-ray emission is detected to a limit of LX/Lbol{\textless}{\~{}}2×10-5, several hundred times below the saturation level observed in early M dwarfs. Similarly, we do not detect H$\alpha$ emission to a limit of LH$\alpha$/Lbol{\textless}{\~{}}2×10-7, the deepest for any L dwarf observed to date. The ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity is at least 4 orders of magnitude in excess of that observed in a wide range of active stars (including M dwarfs), providing the first direct confirmation that late-M and L dwarfs violate the radio/X-ray correlation. The radio emission is due to gyrosynchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field of about 175 G, which is maintained on timescales longer than 3 yr. The detected 3 hr period may be due to (1) the orbital motion of a companion at a separation of about 5 stellar radii, similar to the configuration of RS CVn systems, (2) an equatorial rotation velocity of about 37 km s-1 and an anchored, long-lived magnetic field, or (3) periodic release of magnetic stresses in the form of weak flares. In the case of orbital motion, the magnetic activity may be induced by the companion, possibly explaining the unusual pattern of activity and the long-lived signal. We conclude that fully convective stars can maintain a large-scale and stable magnetic field, but the lack of X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission indicates that the atmospheric conditions are markedly different than in early-type stars and even M dwarfs. Similar observations are therefore invaluable for probing both the internal and external structure of low-mass stars and substellar objects, and for providing constraints on dynamo models.},

abstract = {Exoplanets, or planets outside our own solar system, have long been of interest to astronomers; however, only in the past two decades have scientists had the technology to characterize and study planets so far away from us. With advanced telescopes and spectrometers, astronomers are discovering more exoplanets every year. The two most prolific methods for detecting exoplanets, radial velocity, which measures the wobble of an exoplanet's parent star, and transit, which detects the passage of a planet in front of its star, are responsible for the discovery of the vast majority of exoplanets we know about so far. Other methods such as direct imaging, timing, and gravitational microlensing are less applicable but can sometimes yield accurate data to confirm planets found by radial velocity or transit photometry. Astronomers will continue to find large numbers of new exoplanets in the near future, but it will become increasingly harder to do so after all the planets close to our solar system are discovered.},

abstract = {Direct imaging has confirmed the existence of substellar companions on wide orbits. To understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of these companions, the full population properties must be characterized. We aim at detecting giant planet and/or brown dwarf companions around young, nearby, and dusty stars. Our goal is also to provide statistics on the population of giant planets at wide-orbits and discuss planet formation models. We report a deep survey of 59 stars, members of young stellar associations. The observations were conducted with VLT/NaCo at L'-band (3.8 micron). We used angular differential imaging to reach optimal detection performance. A statistical analysis of about 60 {\%} of the young and southern A-F stars closer than 65 pc allows us to derive the fraction of giant planets on wide orbits. We use gravitational instability models and planet population synthesis models following the core-accretion scenario to discuss the occurrence of these companions. We resolve and characterize new visual binaries and do not detect any new substellar companion. The survey's median detection performance reaches contrasts of 10 mag at 0.5as and 11.5 mag at 1as. We find the occurrence of planets to be between 10.8-24.8 {\%} at 68 {\%} confidence level assuming a uniform distribution of planets in the interval 1-13 Mj and 1-1000 AU. Considering the predictions of formation models, we set important constraints on the occurrence of massive planets and brown dwarf companions that would have formed by GI. We show that this mechanism favors the formation of rather massive clump (Mclump {\textgreater} 30 Mj) at wide (a {\textgreater} 40 AU) orbits which might evolve dynamically and/or fragment. For the population of close-in giant planets that would have formed by CA, our survey marginally explore physical separations ({\textless}20 AU) and cannot constrain this population.},

abstract = {Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the newly discovered peculiar L dwarf 2MASS J11263991-5003550 are presented. Folkes et al. classified this source as a high proper motion L9+/-1 dwarf based on its strong H2O absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m. We find that the optical spectrum of 2MASS J1126-5003 is in fact consistent with that of a normal L4.5 dwarf with notably enhanced FeH absorption at 9896 {\AA}. However, its near-infrared spectrum is unusually blue, with strong H2O and weak CO bands similar in character to several recently identified ``blue L dwarfs.'' Using 2MASS J1126-5003 as a case study, and guided by trends in the condensate cloud models of Burrows et al. and Marley et al., we find that the observed spectral peculiarities of these sources can be adequately explained by the presence of thin and/or large-grained condensate clouds as compared to normal field L dwarfs. Atypical surface gravities or metallicities alone cannot reproduce the observed peculiarities, although they may be partly responsible for the unusual condensate properties. We also rule out unresolved multiplicity as a cause for the spectral peculiarities of 2MASS J1126-5003. Our analysis is supported by examination of Spitzer mid-infrared spectral data from Cushing et al. which show that bluer L dwarfs tend to have weaker 10 $\mu$m absorption, a feature tentatively associated with silicate oxide grains. With their unique spectral properties, blue L dwarfs like 2MASS J1126-5003 should prove useful in studying the formation and properties of condensates and condensate clouds in low-temperature atmospheres. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {Stellar multiplicity is believed to influence planetary formation and evolution, although the precise nature and extent of this role remain ambiguous. We present a study aimed at testing the role of stellar multiplicity in the formation and/or evolution of the most massive, close-in planetary and substellar companions. Using past and new direct imaging observations, as well as the Gaia DR2 catalogue, we searched for wide binary companions to 38 stars hosting massive giant planets or brown dwarfs (M {\textgreater} 7 M Jup) on orbits shorter than ∼1 AU. We report the discovery of two new comoving systems uncovered in Gaia DR2 (WASP-14 and WASP-18). From a robust Bayesian statistical analysis, we derived a binary fraction of 79.0 +13.2 −14.7 {\%} between 20−10,000 AU for our sample, twice as high as for field stars with a 3-$\sigma$ significance. This binary frequency was found to be larger than for lower-mass planets on similar orbits, and we observed a marginally higher binary rate for inner companions with periods shorter than 10 days. These results demonstrate that stellar companions greatly influence the formation and/or evolution of these systems, suggesting that the role played by binary companions becomes more important for higher-mass planets, and that this trend may be enhanced for systems with tighter orbits. Our analysis also revealed a peak in binary separation at 250 AU, highlighting a shortfall of close binaries among our sample. This indicates that the mechanisms affecting planet and brown dwarf formation or evolution in binaries must operate from wide separations, although we found that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism is unlikely to be the dominant underlying process. We conclude that binarity plays a crucial role in the existence of very massive short-period giant planets and brown dwarf desert inhabitants, which are almost exclusively observed in multiple systems.},

abstract = {Binks {\&} Jeffries and Malo et al. have recently reported Li depletion boundary (LDB) ages for the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group (BPMG) which are twice as old as the oft-cited kinematic age of ˜12 Myr. In this study, we present (1) a new evaluation of the internal kinematics of the BPMG using the revised Hipparcos astrometry and best available published radial velocities, and assess whether a useful kinematic age can be derived, and (2) derive an isochronal age based on the placement of the A-, F-, and G-type stars in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). We explore the kinematics of the BPMG looking at velocity trends along Galactic axes, and conducting traceback analyses assuming linear trajectories, epicyclic orbit approximation, and orbit integration using a realistic gravitational potential. None of the methodologies yield a kinematic age with small uncertainties using modern velocity data. Expansion in the Galactic X and Y directions is significant only at the 1.7$\sigma$ and 2.7$\sigma$ levels, and together yields an overall kinematic age with a wide range (13-58 Myr; 95 per cent CL). The A-type members are all on the zero-age main sequence, suggestive of an age of {\textgreater}20 Myr, and the loci of the CMD positions for the late-F- and G-type pre-main-sequence BPMG members have a median isochronal age of 22 Myr (± 3 Myr statistical, ±1 Myr systematic) when considering four sets of modern theoretical isochrones. The results from recent LDB and isochronal age analyses are now in agreement with a median BPMG age of 23 ± 3 Myr (overall 1$\sigma$ uncertainty, including ±2 Myr statistical and ±2 Myr systematic uncertainties).},

abstract = {SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 has previously been classified as an sdM9.5 subdwarf. However, it's very blue J − K colour (–0.15±0.17) suggests a much lower metallicity compared to normal sdM9.5 subdwarfs. Here we re-classify this object as a usdL1.5 subdwarf based on a new optical and near–infrared spectrum obtained with X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope. Spectral fitting with BT-Settl models leads to T eff = 2450±150 K, [Fe/H] = –2.4±0.2 and log g = 5.5±0.25. We estimate a mass for SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 of 0.0855±0.0015 M which is just below the hydrogen-burning minimum mass at [Fe/H] = –2.4 (∼0.0875 M) according to evolutionary models. Our analysis thus shows SDSS J0104+15 to be the most metal-poor and highest mass substellar object known to date. We found that SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 is joined by another five known L subdwarfs (2MASS J05325346+8246465, 2MASS J06164006−6407194, SDSS J125637.16−022452.2, ULAS J151913.03−000030.0, and 2MASS J16262034+3925190) in a 'halo brown dwarf transition zone' in the T eff – [Fe/H] plane, which represents a narrow mass range in which unsteady nuclear fusion occurs. This halo brown dwarf transition zone forms a 'substellar subdwarf gap' for mid L to early T types.},

abstract = {The properties of multiple stellar systems have long provided important empirical constraints for star formation theories, enabling (along with several other lines of evidence) a concrete, qualitative picture of the birth and early evolution of normal stars. At very low masses (VLM; M {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1 M{\_}sun), down to and below the hydrogen burning minimum mass, our understanding of formation processes is not as clear, with several competing theories now under consideration. One means of testing these theories is through the empirical characterization of VLM multiple systems. Here, we review the results of various VLM multiplicity studies to date. These systems can be generally characterized as closely separated (93{\%} have projected separations Delta {\textless} 20 AU) and near equal-mass (77{\%} have M{\_}2/M{\_}1 {\textgreater}= 0.8) occurring infrequently (perhaps 10-30{\%}). Both the frequency and maximum separation of stellar and brown dwarf binaries steadily decrease for lower system masses, suggesting that VLM binary formation and/or evolution may be a mass-dependent process. There is evidence for a fairly rapid decline in the number of loosely-bound systems below {\~{}}0.3 M{\_}sun, corresponding to a factor of 10-20 increase in the minimum binding energy of VLM binaries as compared to more massive stellar binaries. This wide-separation ``desert'' is present among both field ({\~{}}1-5 Gyr) and older ({\textgreater} 100 Myr) cluster systems, while the youngest ({\textless}{\~{}}10 Myr) VLM binaries, particularly those in nearby, low-density star forming regions, appear to have somewhat different systemic properties. We compare these empirical trends to predictions laid out by current formation theories, and outline future observational studies needed to probe the full parameter space of the lowest mass multiple systems.},

abstract = {Photometric monitoring from warm Spitzer reveals that the L3 dwarf DENIS-P J1058.7-1548 varies sinusoidally in brightness with a period of 4.25 +0.26/-0.16 hours and an amplitude of 0.388 +/- 0.043{\%} (peak-to-valley) in the 3.6 micron band, confirming the reality of a 4.31 +/- 0.31 hour periodicity detected in J-band photometry from the SOAR telescope. The J-band variations are a factor of 2.17 +/- 0.35 larger in amplitude than those at 3.6 microns, while 4.5 micron Spitzer observations yield a 4.5 micron/3.6 micron amplitude ratio of only 0.23 +/- 0.15, consistent with zero 4.5 micron variability. This wide range in amplitudes indicates rotationally modulated variability due to magnetic phenomena and/or inhomogeneous cloud cover. Weak H-alpha emission indicates some magnetic activity, but it is difficult to explain the observed amplitudes by magnetic phenomena unless they are combined with cloud inhomogeneities (which might have a magnetic cause). However, inhomogenous cloudcover alone can explain all our observations, and our data align with theory in requiring that the regions with the thickest clouds also have the lowest effective temperature. Combined with published v sin(i) results, our rotation period yields a 95{\%} confidence lower limit of 0.111 solar radii on the radius of DENIS-P J1058.7-1548, suggesting upper limits of 320 Myr and 0.055 solar masses on the age and mass. These limits should be regarded cautiously because of 3-sigma inconsistencies with other data; however, a lower limit of 45 degrees on the inclination is more secure. DENIS-P J1058.7-1548 is only the first of nearly two dozen low-amplitude variables discovered and analyzed by the Weather on Other Worlds project.},

abstract = {By generalizing the theory of convection to any type of thermal and compositional source terms (diabatic processes), we show that thermohaline convection in Earth oceans, fingering convection in stellar atmospheres, and moist convection in Earth atmosphere are deriving from the same general diabatic convective instability. We show also that "radiative convection" triggered by CO/CH4 transition with radiative transfer in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs is analog to moist and thermohaline convection. We derive a generalization of the mixing length theory to include the effect of source terms in 1D codes. We show that CO/CH4 radiative convection could significantly reduce the temperature gradient in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs similarly to moist convection in Earth atmosphere thus possibly explaining the reddening in brown-dwarf spectra. By using idealized two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in the Ledoux unstable regime, we show that compositional source terms can indeed provoke a reduction of the temperature gradient. The L/T transition could be explained by a bifurcation between the adiabatic and diabatic convective transports and could be seen as a giant cooling crisis: an analog of the boiling crisis in liquid/steam-water convective flows. This mechanism with other chemical transitions could be present in many giant and earth-like exoplanets. The study of the impact of different parameters (effective temperature, compositional changes) on CO/CH4 radiative convection and the analogy with Earth moist and thermohaline convection is opening the possibility to use brown dwarfs to better understand some aspects of the physics at play in the climate of our own planet.},

abstract = {I introduce a general, Bayesian method for modelling univariate time series data assumed to be drawn from a continuous, stochastic process. The method accommodates arbitrary temporal sampling, and takes into account measurement uncertainties for arbitrary error models (not just Gaussian) on both the time and signal variables. Any model for the deterministic component of the variation of the signal with time is supported, as is any model of the stochastic component on the signal and time variables. Models illustrated here are constant and sinusoidal models for the signal mean combined with a Gaussian stochastic component, as well as a purely stochastic model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is determined via Monte Carlo sampling. Models are compared using the "cross-validation likelihood", in which the posterior-averaged likelihood for different partitions of the data are combined. In principle this is more robust to changes in the prior than is the evidence (the prior-averaged likelihood). The method is demonstrated by applying it to the light curves of 11 ultra cool dwarf stars, claimed by a previous study to show statistically significant variability. This is reassessed here by calculating the cross-validation likelihood for various time series models, including a null hypothesis of no variability beyond the error bars. 10 of 11 light curves are confirmed as being significantly variable, and one of these seems to be periodic, with two plausible periods identified. Another object is best described by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a conclusion which is obviously limited to the set of models actually tested.},

abstract = {We have conducted a photometric monitoring program of 3 field late-L brown dwarfs looking for evidence of non-axisymmetric structure or temporal variability in their photospheres. The observations were performed using Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 and 8 micron bandpasses and were designed to cover at least one rotational period of each object. One-sigma RMS (root mean squared) uncertainties of less than 3 mmag at 4.5 micron and around 9 mmag at 8 micron were achieved. Two out of the three objects studied exhibit some modulation in their light curves at 4.5 micron - but not 8 micron - with periods of 7.4 hr and 4.6 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 10 mmag and 8 mmag. Although the lack of detectable 8 micron variation suggests an instrumental origin for the detected variations, the data may nevertheless still be consistent with intrinsic variability since the shorter wavelength IRAC bandpasses probe more deeply into late L dwarf atmospheres than the longer wavelengths. A cloud feature occupying a small percentage (1-2 {\%}) of the visible hemisphere could account for the observed amplitude of variation. If, instead, the variability is indeed instrumental in origin, then our non-variable L dwarfs could be either completely covered with clouds or objects whose clouds are smaller and uniformly distributed. Such scenarios would lead to very small photometric variations. Followup IRAC photometry at 3.6 and 5.8 micron bandpasses should distinguish between the two cases. In any event, the present observations provide the most sensitive search to date for structure in the photospheres of late-L dwarfs at mid-IR wavelengths, and our photometry provides stringent upper limits to the extent to which the photospheres of these transition L dwarfs are structured.},

abstract = {The re-emergence of the 0.99 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m FeH feature in brown dwarfs of early- to mid-T spectral type has been suggested as evidence for cloud disruption where flux from deep, hot regions below the Fe cloud deck can emerge. The same mechanism could account for color changes at the L/T transition and photometric variability. We present the first observations of spectroscopic variability of brown dwarfs covering the 0.99 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m FeH feature. We observed the spatially resolved very nearby brown dwarf binary WISE J104915.57-531906.1 (Luhman 16AB), a late-L and early-T dwarf, with HST/WFC3 in the G102 grism at 0.8-1.15 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. We find significant variability at all wavelengths for both brown dwarfs, with peak-to-valley amplitudes of 9.3{\%} for Luhman 16B and 4.5{\%} for Luhman 16A. This represents the first unambiguous detection of variability in Luhman 16A. We estimate a rotational period between 4.5 and 5.5 h, very similar to Luhman 16B. Variability in both components complicates the interpretation of spatially unresolved observations. The probability for finding large amplitude variability in any two brown dwarfs is less than 10{\%}. Our finding may suggest that a common but yet unknown feature of the binary is important for the occurrence of variability. For both objects, the amplitude is nearly constant at all wavelengths except in the deep K I feature below 0.84 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. No variations are seen across the 0.99 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m FeH feature. The observations lend strong further support to cloud height variations rather than holes in the silicate clouds, but cannot fully rule out holes in the iron clouds. We re-evaluate the diagnostic potential of the FeH feature as a tracer of cloud patchiness.},

We report here the first resolved variability monitoring of both the T0.5 and L7.5 components. We obtained 4 hours of focused observations on the night of UT 2013-04-22, as well as 4 hours of defocused (unresolved) observations on the night of UT 2013-04-16. We note a number of robust trends in our light curves. The r′ and i′ light curves appear to be anticorrelated with z′ and H for the T0.5 component and in the unresolved lightcurve. In the defocused dataset, J appears correlated with z′ and H and anticorrelated with r′ and i′, while in the focused dataset we measure no variability for J at the level of our photometric precision, likely due to evolving weather phenomena. In our focused T0.5 component lightcurve, the K band lightcurve displays a significant phase offset relative to both H and z′. We argue that the measured phase offsets are correlated with atmospheric pressure probed at each band, as estimated from 1D atmospheric models. We also report low-amplitude variability in i′ and z′ intrinsic to the L7.5 component.},

abstract = {We report the results of a {\$}J{\$} band search for cloud-related variability in the atmospheres of 62 L4-T9 dwarfs using the Du Pont 2.5-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. We find 9 of 57 objects included in our final analysis to be significantly variable with {\textgreater}99{\%} confidence, 5 of which are new discoveries. In our study, strong variability (peak-to-peak amplitudes {\textgreater}2{\%}) are confined to the L/T transition (4/16 objects with L9-T3.5 spectral types and 0/41 objects for all other spectral types). The probability that the observed occurrence rates for strong variability inside and outside the L/T transition originate from the same underlying true occurrence rate is excluded with {\textgreater}99.7{\%} confidence. These observations suggest that the settling of condensate clouds below the photosphere in brown dwarf atmospheres does not occur in a spatially uniform manner. Rather, the formation and sedimentation of dust grains at the L/T transition is coupled to atmospheric dynamics, resulting in highly contrasting regions of thick and thin clouds and/or clearings. Outside the L/T transition we identify 5 weak variables (peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.6{\%}-1.6{\%}). Excluding L9-T3.5 spectral types, we infer that {\$}60{\^{}}{\{}+22{\}}{\_}{\{}-18{\}}{\$}{\%} of targets vary with amplitudes of 0.5{\%}{\$}-{\$}1.6{\%}, suggesting that surface heterogeneities are ubiquitous among L and T dwarfs. Our survey establishes a significant link between strong variability and L/T transition spectral types, providing evidence in support of the hypothesis that cloud holes contribute to the abrupt decline in condensate opacity and 1 micron brightening observed in this regime. More generally, fractional cloud coverage is an important model parameter for brown dwarfs and giant planets, especially those with L/T transition spectral types and colors. [ABRIDGED]},

We estimate its model-dependent mass in the range 11-12 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} at the age of the AB Doradus moving group, and its trigonometric parallax distance of 12.7 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 1.5 pc makes it one of the nearest known isolated planetary-mass objects. The unusually red continuum of 2MASS J13243553+6358281 in the near-infrared was previously suspected to be caused by an unresolved L+T brown dwarf binary, although it was never observed with high-spatial resolution imaging. This new evidence of youth suggests that a low surface gravity may be sufficient to explain this peculiar feature.

We find 39 objects to be high-likelihood or bona fide members of nearby moving groups, 92 objects to be ambiguous members and 21 objects that are non-members. We find that gravity classification and photometric color separate 5-150 Myr sources from {\textgreater} 3 Gyr field objects, but they do not correlate one-to-one with the narrower 5 -150 Myr age range. The absolute magnitudes of low-gravity sources from J band through W3 show a flux redistribution when compared to equivalent field sources that is correlated with spectral subtype. Clouds, which are a far more dominant opacity source for L dwarfs, are the likely cause. On CMDs, the latest-type low-gravity L dwarfs drive the elbow of the L/T transition up to 1 mag redder and 1 mag fainter than field dwarfs at M{\_}J but are consistent with or brighter than the elbow at M{\_}W1 and M{\_}W2. Furthermore, there is an indication on CMD's (such as M{\_}J versus (J-W2) of increasingly redder sequences separated by gravity classification. Examining bolometric luminosities for planets and low-gravity objects, we confirm that young M dwarfs are overluminous while young L dwarfs are normal compared to the field. This translates into warmer M dwarf temperatures compared to the field sequence while lower temperatures for L dwarfs.},

abstract = {A variety of observations provide evidence for vigorous motion in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets. Motivated by these observations, we examine the dynamical regime of the circulation in the atmospheres and interiors of these objects. Brown dwarfs rotate rapidly, and for plausible wind speeds, the flow at large scales will be rotationally dominated. We present three-dimensional, global, numerical simulations of convection in the interior, which demonstrate that at large scales, the convection aligns in the direction parallel to the rotation axis. Convection occurs more efficiently at high latitudes than low latitudes, leading to systematic equator-to-pole temperature differences that may reach {\~{}}1 K near the top of the convection zone. The interaction of convection with the overlying, stably stratified atmosphere will generate a wealth of atmospheric waves, and we argue that, as in the stratospheres of planets in the solar system, the interaction of these waves with the mean flow will cause a significant atmospheric circulation at regional to global scales. At large scales, this should consist of stratified turbulence (possibly organizing into coherent structures such as vortices and jets) and an accompanying overturning circulation. We present an approximate analytic theory of this circulation, which predicts characteristic horizontal temperature variations of several to {\~{}}50 K, horizontal wind speeds of {\~{}}10-300 m s–1, and vertical velocities that advect air over a scale height in {\~{}}105-106 s. This vertical mixing may help to explain the chemical disequilibrium observed on some brown dwarfs. Moreover, the implied large-scale organization of temperature perturbations and vertical velocities suggests that near the L/T transition, patchy clouds can form near the photosphere, helping to explain recent observations of brown-dwarf variability in the near-IR.},

abstract = {Brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets exhibit significant evidence for active atmospheric circulation, which induces a large-scale patchiness in the cloud structure that evolves significantly over time, as evidenced by infrared light curves and Doppler maps. These observations raise critical questions about the fundamental nature of the circulation, its time variability, and the overall relationship to the circulation on Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn themselves exhibit numerous robust zonal (east-west) jet streams at the cloud level; moreover, both planets exhibit long-term stratospheric oscillations involving perturbations of zonal wind and temperature that propagate downward over time on timescales of {\~{}}4 years (Jupiter) and {\~{}}15 years (Saturn). These oscillations, dubbed the Quasi Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) for Jupiter and the Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO) on Saturn, are thought to be analogous to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) on Earth, which is driven by upward propagation of equatorial waves from the troposphere. To investigate these issues, we here present global, three-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations of the flow in the stratified atmosphere--overlying the convective interior--of brown dwarfs and Jupiter-like planets. The effect of interior convection is parameterized by inducing small-scale, randomly varying perturbations in the radiative-convective boundary at the base of the model. In the simulations, the convective perturbations generate atmospheric waves and turbulence that interact with the rotation to produce numerous zonal jets. Moreover, the equatorial stratosphere exhibits stacked eastward and westward jets that migrate downward over time, exactly as occurs in the terrestrial QBO, Jovian QQO, and Saturnian SAO. This is the first demonstration of a QBO-like phenomenon in 3D numerical simulations of a giant planet.},

@article{Tremblin2017,
abstract = {Atmospheric modeling of low-gravity (VL-G) young brown dwarfs remains a challenge. The presence of very thick clouds has been suggested because of their extremely red near-infrared (NIR) spectra, but no cloud models provide a good fit to the data with a radius compatible with evolutionary models for these objects. We show that cloudless atmospheres assuming a temperature gradient reduction caused by fingering convection provides a very good model to match the observed VL-G NIR spectra. The sequence of extremely red colors in the NIR for atmospheres with effective temperature from {\~{}}2000 K down to {\~{}}1200 K is very well reproduced with predicted radii typical of young low-gravity objects. Future observations with NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide more constrains in the mid-infrared, helping to confirm/refute whether or not the NIR reddening is caused by fingering convection. We suggest that the presence/absence of clouds will be directly determined by the silicate absorption features that can be observed with MIRI. JWST will therefore be able to better characterize the atmosphere of these hot young brown dwarfs and their low-gravity exoplanet analogues.},

@article{Burningham2017,
abstract = {We present the first results from applying the spectral inversion technique in the cloudy L dwarf regime. Our new framework provides a flexible approach to modelling cloud opacity which can be built incrementally as the data requires, and improves upon previous retrieval experiments in the brown dwarf regime by allowing for scattering in two stream radiative transfer. Our first application of the tool to two mid-L dwarfs is able to closely reproduce their near-infrared spectra, far more closely that grid models for the targets Teff and gravity. By extrapolating our retrieved spectra we estimate for 2MASS J05002100+0330501 {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} = 1835{\^{}}{\{}+22{\}}{\_}{\{}-19{\}}{\$}K and {\$}\backslashlog g = 5.2{\^{}}{\{}+0.08{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.19{\}}{\$} and for 2MASSW J2224438-015852 we find {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} = 1735{\^{}}{\{}+16{\}}{\_}{\{}-19{\}}{\$}K and {\$}\backslashlog g = 5.28{\^{}}{\{}+0.07{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.14{\}}{\$}, in close agreement with previous empirical estimates. Our best model for both objects includes an optically thick cloud deck which passes {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}cloud{\}} {\textgreater} 1{\$} (looking down) at a pressure of around 5 bar. This pressure is too high for silicate species to condense, and we argue that corundum and/or iron clouds are responsible for this cloud opacity. We also find the opacity consistent with a cloud of particles following a Hansen distribution dominated by sub-micron sized particles. Our retrieved profiles are cooler at depth, and warmer at altitude than the forward grid models that we compare, and we argue that some form of heating mechanism may be at work in the upper atmospheres of these L dwarfs. We also identify anomalously high CO abundance in both targets, which does not correlate with the warmth of our upper atmospheres or our choice of cloud model.},
